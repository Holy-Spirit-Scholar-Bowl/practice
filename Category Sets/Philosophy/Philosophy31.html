Philosophy/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>One response to an attempt to do this posited a "perfect island" and was advanced by Guanilo. The argument from degree is one of the Quinque Viae, or Five Ways, which are five proofs of this contention listed by Thomas Aquinas. St. Anselm attempted to prove this via the "ontological argument." Many "cosmological" arguments in favor of this are based on the assumption that there must be a first mover or first cause.

This character relates the story of Er to demonstrate the immortality of the soul, and refutes Thrasymachus's idea that justice is "the advantage of the stronger."

Philosophy/All (OLEFIN 2011)<br><strong>This man claimed that society progresses via the "cunning of reason" and he organized his works around categorial triads. This thinker also posited that free will can only exist in a society with property rights and contracts.

Philosophy/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>Per the Transcendental Aesthetic section of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, this concept grounds our "inner sense" as a "form of pure intuition." In Book Eleven of Confessions, Augustine expresses confusion at defining this concept, but is certain that God enables it. Some philosophers argue that this concept is a merely relative "B-series" rather than an objective "A-series". This concept was paired with "free will" in a book by Henri Bergson that described consciousness in terms of </strong> "duration". A person who radically reversed their place in this concept could trigger the grandfather paradox.

Philosophy/All (Harvard Fall Tournament 2010)<br>One chapter of this work compares imagination to the lights one sees upon pressing one's eye, and calls previous philosophers “ancient pretenders to natural knowledge” that chapter questions why Jesus suggests spirits cannot be incorporeal. That chapter is from its third part, “Of a Christian Commonwealth,” while an earlier chapter establishes the “first and second natural laws” and explains that a man may transfer his freedom to another via a covenant. This work supposes that before the creation of the first state, humanity existed in a “war of all against all,” the state of nature.

Philosophy/All (HFT 2008)<br>This engineer may have devised a technique to divert the Halys River for Croesus of Lydia, and, according to Callimachus, he taught how to navigate by both Ursa Major and Minor. Like Pythagoras, he learned geometry from the Egyptians, and he discovered that a circle is bisected by its diameter, but he is more famous for his work in cosmology, since he was supposedly the first theorize that reality derives from an “arche,” or “principal substance,” which he thought was moisture or water. FTP, name this philosopher of Miletus who taught Anaximander.<br>ANSWER: <u>Thales</u> of Miletus<br><br>11.

Philosophy/None (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>Hugo Grotius' theory of the natural right of individuals was a precursor to this philosophical concept. Proudhon proposed an anarchist version of this concept, which another philosopher described in a work that explains how every individual's opinion in isolation will together produce the best decision for the state, otherwise known as the "general will." That work argues that voluntarily entering into a state of slavery is illogical and begins "man is born free but everywhere he is in chains."

Philosophy/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>George Meredith noted that the French understand men and women better than the British do, due to having a "school" of this concept, in his Essay on this concept. G.K. Chesterton divided this concept into "old" and "new," while a more common division is between "high" and "low."

Philosophy/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>This thinker defined logic as “formal semiotic” and created three interlocking typologies of signs, including that between tone, token, and type and between icon, index, and symbol. He suggested that anyone whose process of thought in deciding to pay a horse-car driver one nickel or five pennies actually proceeds from doubt to belief would have to be nearly insane, and calls belief the “demi-cadence which closes a musical phrase in the symphony of our intellectual life.” In that work, this proposer of </strong> tychism claims that different ways of measuring the speed of light will all converge upon refinement to the same value and describes vector addition using a “parallelogram of forces” to describe the notion of weight.
