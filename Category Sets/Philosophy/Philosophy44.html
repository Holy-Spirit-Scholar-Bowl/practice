This author of Alciphron attacked Locke’s distinction between primary and secondary qualities in a work that uses the pleasure-pain argument to prove that pain cannot exist independently of the mind. That work argues that the mind cannot conceive of mind-independent objects via the master argument. He concluded that the causes of passive ideas cannot be matter and instead must be the mind of God.

It argues that ideas lack the forcefulness of actual and that the source of all ideas is ultimately impressions in “Of the Origin of Ideas”, though it provides a possible counter-example of a “missing shade of blue”. It distinguishes “relations of ideas” from “matters of fact”, known as the author's namesake fork, and goes on to question whether we can trust induction.

Deflationist and coherence theories describe this concept, which Charles Peirce ("PURSE") called the "end of inquiry."
