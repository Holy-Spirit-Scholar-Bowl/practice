1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 1 2008)<br>The BEA currently uses the more accurate “chain weighting” method to calculate this quantity, and Okun's law relates the gap in this quantity to unemployment. Purchasing power parity is usually taken into account when comparing it between two nations.

Lefcourt related it to a shift in the locus of control, and another experiment testing it had babies attempt to control a mobile and was done by Finkelstein and Ramey. The original experiment testing it was followed up by another one using curare, and the subjects in the third group showed signs of clinical depression. That first experiment was conducted with the help of Overmeier, and involved yolking and shocking dogs. For 10 points, name this behavior in which an organism doesn't move away from a negative stimulus even when they can, originally shown by Seligman.<br>ANSWER: <u>learned helplessness</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (BHSAT 2011)<br>Its study was pioneered by a psychologist who developed a theory based on the lexical hypothesis; that psychologist is Gordon Allport. Lewis Goldberg proposed a theory of this concept often summarized CANOE or OCEAN as a mnemonic for its Big Five. One type theory of this characterizes people using four scales with designations such as “INTJ” and “ESFP,” and is named for Myers and Briggs. Today, the MMPI is the standard test used to evaluate this characteristic. For 10 points, identify this thing that often leads to different readings of a Rorschach test, which describes inherent characteristics that distinguish people from one another.<br>ANSWER: <u>personality</u><br><br>5. Social Science/None (NASAT 2015)<br>In 1993, Prince and Smolensky developed a new approach to this subfield based on evaluating "constraint" sets, called Optimality Theory. The basic units of study in this subfield are represented as a column of properties marked with pluses and minuses within a large set of brackets in Roman Jakobson's "distinctive feature" theory. This subfield might study when "underlying representations" are affected by changes such as syncope or epenthesis, and seeks rules determining when people might produce or perceive features such as aspiration or voicing. For 10 points, name this subfield of linguistics focused on the rules and patterns of sounds within language, whose basic unit is the phoneme.<br>ANSWER: phonology [prompt on "linguistics" or "computational linguistics" before mention; do not accept "phonetics"]<br><br>6. Social Science/All (JAMES 2013)<br><strong>This man worked with Bärbel Inhelder to perform an experiment in which subjects were shown a 3D view of a mountain. This psychologist posited that people underwent accommodation or assimilation to adapt new information about the world into an existing schema. This psychologist identified the ability to realize an object was still there even after its </strong> removal from sight; he found that that ability, object permanence, was not present in those less than two years old. Preoperational and sensorimotor are among the stages of this man's theory of cognitive development for children. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist.<br>ANSWER: Jean <u>Piaget</u><br><br>7. Social Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>This writer wrote about the uses of chicken blood in getting around spoken customs and criticized the socialization of the American middle class in the final chapter of her most famous work because they experience more stress than the community of Ta'u.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>James Laidlaw critiqued this man's major work using the example of a Jainist religious practice. He collaborated with a friend and authority on Celtic culture to produce Essay on the Nature and Function of Sacrifice and discussed the Polynesian concept of mana in his best known work. This collaborator with Henri Hubert described how the title concept of that essay is imbued with the identity of the </strong> original owner, and thus cannot be totally alienated. The concept of "total prestation” explains the expectation of reciprocity associated with the title concept of his most famous work.

Social Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>One theory of these phenomena was developed by Karl Schimper and Louis Agassiz, whose work drew upon the ideas of Goethe and de Charpentier. The first of these events, probably triggered by the Great Oxygenation Event, was known as the Huronian, while the most recent one created many pluvial lakes. They can be identified through chemical proxies such as isotopes in sediment </strong> cores, and organisms that lived during these time periods include ground sloths, saber-tooth cats, and mastodons.

In one of his works, he acknowledged that applying his most famous theory to children was much more likely to induce terror in them than happiness, comparing it to separating them from the herd. He criticized other psychologists for writing lists of psychological drives, instead of a unified system, in A Theory of Human </strong> Motivation. In Motivation and Personality, he described transcendental experiences that fundamentally alter their subjects, which he termed peak experiences, as part of a theory that culminates in self-actualization.

Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>A concept identical to this state in the Kevatta Sutta is described by Nagarjuna in the Long Discourses. A prominent figure in the Chán school holds that anatta, non-self doctrine, is antithetical to it. When preceded by “pari,” it refers to the death of one who is already in this state. Its union with samsara is bodhi in Mahayana Buddhism. In Jainism, an arhat becomes a siddha after achieving this concept, which can be translated as “blown out,” like a candle.
