1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>Barriers to entry are one way that existing firms can have the "incumbent" form of this, as compared to new firms in a market. The ability to produce a good more efficiently in a national economy is its "absolute" form. Two countries which produce more of two goods by respectively specializing in one and the other are benefiting from another form of this, which was originally explained in terms of British cloth and Portuguese wine by David Ricardo. For 10 points, give this economic term that appears in justifications of international trade in its "comparative" form.<br>ANSWER: advantage<br><br>2. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>Georg Bossong discovered that these grammatical elements are marked differently in DOM languages. In ergative languages, they are marked by the absolutive case. In Latin, the ablative case is sometimes used for these sentence elements though they are more commonly marked by the dative and accusative cases. In languages like Korean and Japanese this sentence element occurs before the verb, but in English it occurs after the verb. They are not used with intransitive verbs and can be classified as prepositional, indirect, or direct. For 10 points, name this grammatical element that receives the action of the verb, often paired with a subject.<br>ANSWER: <u>object</u><br><br>3. Social Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>If the demand curve is linear, then it will have twice the slope of the marginal revenue curve in this market, and if a per-unit tax is applied to goods, then the price will rise by twice the amount of the tax. Price minus marginal cost all over price is equivalent to the negative inverse of demand elasticity in this market, and is also known as the Lerner Index. Deadweight loss results from the difference between the gain in producer surplus and the loss of consumer surplus, and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index for this type of market is ten thousand, which indicates that the entire market share lies with one seller. FTP, identify this type of market in which there is only one producer.<br>ANSWER: <u>monopoly</u> (do not accept monopolistic competition)<br><br>4. Social Science/None (NASAT 2015)<br>In 2014, the Fresno City Council agreed to remove one of these places designed by Garrett Eckbo on Fulton Street. Victor Gruen built one for Kalamazoo, the first in the United States. Mayor Jane Byrne turned nine blocks of State Street in Chicago into one of these places in an unsuccessful attempt to keep businesses from leaving the city center. In the 1960s and 70s, many were built in hopes of revitalizing downtowns and competing with places like the Southdale Center in the Minneapolis suburbs. More successful examples have been built in college towns, like the one in Charlotttesville, Virginia or on Pearl Street in Boulder, Colorado.

Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2012)<br>A variation of this experiment conducted by Black and Bevan involved handing out a questionnaire to moviegoers.

For 10 points, identify this Swiss psychologist who theorized a four-stage model of cognitive development in children.<br>ANSWER: Jean Piaget<br><br>7. Social Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>Ronald Jones discussed labor immobility and this concept in his attempts to expand the Hecksher-Ohlin model.  Its formulator recognized that it did not hold for when all means of production are internationally mobile, while Paul Samuelson argued that it was a social-science construct that was both true and non-trivial.  It's not the Iron Law of Wages, but it was elucidated in the Essay on the External Corn Trade by David Ricardo.  An example of it explains why a man who is the best lawyer and typist in a city is better off only practicing law due to opportunity cost.  For 10 points, identify this concept from economics that describes the benefits of trade specialization, less stringent than absolute advantage.<br>ANSWER: <u>Comparative</u> Advantage<br><br>8.

This aggregate form of this concept can be seen as the total of this concept for a country’s GDP when inventory levels are static.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>He analyzed the “Hermetic tradition” from gnosticism through alchemy as a necessary expression of the unconscious that he saw as suppressed by mainstream Christianity. To explain the phenomena encountered in his Burghölzli experiments with word association, he coined the term “complex.” He believed that “individuation,” or the person’s relationship with history and mythology, could give meaning to the elderly, and he divided people into introverts and extroverts.

Social Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>_This thinker defined states as organizations that monopolize the legitimate use of force in their regions. This social scientist argued that the modern world evolves toward a state where people can increasingly master their environment through calculation, which leads to the rise of bureaucracies.
