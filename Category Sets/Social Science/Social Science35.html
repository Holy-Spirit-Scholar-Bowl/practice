1. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>One of his ethnographies, drawing primarily from South American sources, described the relationship between home construction and family structure. This man wrote a book which posits that all cultures fall within three progressively more evolved stages; that cultural evolutionist theory examines cultures through benchmarks known as ethna and tracks them through savagery, barbarism, and civilization. One of his most famous books sprung from his field research among the </strong> Iroquois; that book explores the relationships between family members and categorizes all known family systems into six basic groups.

Social Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>After studying forms of monkey intimidation, this man created and contrasted the concepts of B-values and D-values in the context of a concept that was partly inspired by Kurt Goldstein’s The Organism. After his work Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences, he led a shift in his field studying the abnormal to the humanistic. This man’s best-known formulation is outlined in Motivation and Personality  and its components range from safety to a state achieved by few exemplary individuals known as self-actualization. For 10 points, name this American psychologist most famous for his formulation of a hierarchy of needs.<br>ANSWER: Abraham (Harold) Maslow<br><br>3. Social Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XVI 2008)<br>|  Early in this man's career he studied schizophrenia, as well as word association. His work Symbols of Transformation linked the unconscious to mythology and is believed to one reason for his break with a colleague who dismissed him in the Kreuzlingen Gesture. His wife Emma wrote about some of his work, such as his discussion of the animus and anima. Disturbing visions at the onset of war led him to investigate archetypes, leading to his views on the collective unconscious. FTP name this Swiss psychologist known for his break with Freud.<br>ANSWER: Carl Gustav <u>Jung</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>This thinker borrowed the term “unus mundus” to refer to the one reality underlying the world. He termed the phenomenon in which two significant incidents occur simultaneously by chance as “synchronicity.” The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator was inspired by this man’s writings. He developed the concepts of extroversion and introversion, and named the animus and anima as some archetypes. For 10 points, name this Swiss thinker who developed the idea of the “collective unconscious,” a psychoanalyst who broke with Freud.<br>ANSWER: Carl Gustav <u>Jung</u><br><br>5. Social Science/All (WUHSAC IX 2007)<br>In this book, the author states that the level of output in an economy is determined by three factors—a person’s marginal propensity to consume, the marginal efficiency of capital, and the interest rate. It argued that an increase in government expenditures could stimulate an economy caught in a long-term recession, and it ushered in a revolution in macroeconomic thought.

Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>This person wrote of his conviction “that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws” in his book on the unity of knowledge, Consilience. He used a term developed by Suzanne Batra to define species that have a reproductive division of labor, overlapping generations, and cooperative care of the young. He still uses that term, “eusocial,” in his 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth. The branch of science associated with him is based on a 1975 book that has been criticized for its genetic determinism and which attempted to explain the benefits of altruism. Name this expert on ants who wrote the book Sociobiology.<br>ANSWER: Edward O(sborne) Wilson<br><br>7. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>One section of this work describes how the working poor have a mental torpor that make them incapable of “rational conversation,” “tender sentiment,” or “just judgment.” The third section of this work describes the state of agriculture in Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire, shortly after explaining the “natural progress of opulence.” Its fourth section describes the motivations behind establishing colonies, and its opening discussion of the division of labor uses the example of a pin factory. This work presents arguments against mercantilism and introduces the concept of the “invisible hand.” For 10 points, name this work by Adam Smith.<br>ANSWER: The <u>Wealth of Nations</u><br><br>8.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>One work by this man links the “guilty conscience” to the quashing of natural instincts in order to live peacefully with a father-figure, while another posits the projection of negative aspects of ambivalence onto sacred objects. This man described the development of a metaphorical cyborg-like human in a work suggesting that the oceanic feeling could amend his earlier The </strong> Future of an Illusion and modify his conjecture of eros and thanatos as driving forces. "Irma's Injection" is used as an example in another work by this author of Totem and Taboo and Civilization and its Discontents, who claimed that the title entities were wish fulfilments in a work introducing the Oedipus complex.

Social Science/All (MSU/UD Housewrite 2012)<br><strong>The place coding theory for this phenomenon has received support from the asymmetrical nature of masking functions. Scene analysis in this process is aided by sensitivity to temporal shifts as small as one millisecond and is illustrated by the cocktail party effect. Time and intensity differences are also important in its</strong> localization; when cues are impoverished, that can result in a “cone of confusion.” The pinnae, ossicles, and cochlea are, for 10 points, organs that are used for what sense, the detection of pressure waves in air performed by the ear?<br>ANSWER: <u>Audition</u> [or <u>hearing</u> or other obvious equivalents]<br><br>13. Social Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>This thinker described the maintenance of patterns from the "Ancien Regime," despite attempts to restructure society during the French Revolution, in his book The Old Regime and the Revolution.

In addition to Tales of the Cochiti Indians, a work similar to the earlier Zuni Mythology, this author argued in favor of moral relativism in a work that studied the Dobu people as an example of a human culture as a “personality writ large.” She also examined a “shame culture” derived from the concept of giri, although her observations were restricted to internment camps.

Social Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament (FKT) 2011)<br>This man discussed the digestive mechanisms of such species as sundews and Venus Flytraps in his work Insectivorous Plants, and studies this man performed on the Keeling Islands led him to publish The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs. This thinker expounded his idea of sexual selection in The Descent of Man, which was the follow up to a work that was partly inspired by his study of mockingbirds and finches at the Galapagos Islands and on board the Beagle. That work introduced his theory of natural selection. For 10 points, name this early proponent of evolution who authored The Origin of Species.<br>ANSWER: Charles Robert Darwin<br><br>16. Social Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 2 2008)<br>Polish scholars in this field include Maria Czaplicka (chap-litch-ka), who wrote two books about Siberians.

Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>An essay about this substance outlines a triangle that distinguishes "natural" methods of using it from a cultural one that involves a pot of water. Mythologies claims this substance metaphorically bestows a "bull-like strength" and is part of the "same sanguine mythology as wine". A book by Michael Pollan explores the benefits of humans avoiding this substance, an action backed by Peter </strong> Singer and devout Jains.
