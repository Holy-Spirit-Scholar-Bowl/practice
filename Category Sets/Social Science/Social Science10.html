Another work titled for it says that "surplus repression" is generated by capitalism and was written by Herbert Marcuse, pairing this entity with </strong> "eros." Another work with this word in the title analyzed the "oceanic feeling;" written by Freud, that book claims that this entity can only exist by frustrating individual drives and pairs it with "its discontents."

For 10 points, name this American behaviorist, who created a namesake box to research operant conditioning.<br>ANSWER: Burrhus Frederic <u>Skinner</u><br><br>4. Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2015)<br><strong>Many of these systems improve on the setup of Army Beta, which was introduced during World War I. One method of performing this activity features a price tag-shaped blank region in the lower right of cards printed with n-by-n patterns and was designed by John C. Raven. "Progressive matrices" and the WAIS are two types of these things, whose results are often correlated with a value developed by Charles Spearman called </strong> g-factor. A increase in the results of these constructs over time, including the Wechsler varieties, is called the Flynn effect and requires these constructs to be periodically re-normed so calculations of "mental age" don't become inflated. For 10 points, name these evaluations of aptitude which often calculate a person's IQ.<br>ANSWER: intelligence tests [accept any answer indicating ways of evaluating, quantifying, testing, etc. the general intelligence of persons; or IQ tests before "IQ"]<br><br>5. Social Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>In this study, Dorothy and Sheila Ross were collaborating investigators, and a secondary hypothesis tested whether the behavior and learning processes in question were affected by the gender of the actor present. The first phase of this experiment involved one of the actors playing with Tinker toys while sitting across the room from the participant. Other objects in this experiment included [*] innocuous toys like trucks and tea sets, but some subjects chose to use aggressive objects such as dart guns and mallets, emulating the behavior of the adult models. For 10 points, name this experiment on observational learning by Albert Bandura, named for a toy that refuses to fall down.<br>ANSWER: <u>Bobo</u> doll experiment<br><br>6.

Social Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2005)<br>Usually arising from a failure to understand perspective and occurring more frequently in individualist societies, it is best avoided if one heeds “consensus” information and looks for unseen causes, both of which people are less likely to do if in a state of cognitive load. Examined in the laboratory in a 1967 study by Harris and Jones in which subjects determined the pro- or anti-Castro sentiments of certain speakers, this phenomenon is also known as the actor-observer bias. For 10 points, name this psychological tendency of people to overlook situational factors in determining the behavior of other people.<br>ANSWER: <u>fundamental attribution error</u> [accept <u>actor-observer</u> bias early]<br><br>9. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>Joel Garreau described recently-created examples of these things in his book Edge [this], and William Whyte subtitled a book about these entities "Rediscovering the Center". One writer used the example of one named "obsidian" to claim they were older than agriculture, and showed how they drove import replacement in The Economy of [this]. That writer, Jane Jacobs, also argued against conventional renewal projects in Death And Life Of Great American these. Lewis Mumford also described these things "in history" For 10 points, give this term for large urban centers.<br>ANSWER: city<br><br>10. Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>One model of this concept postulates a central executive governing a "phonological loop" and "visuospatial scratchpad," and was developed by Baddeley and Hitch. Increased synchrony of theta wave activity is considered a neurological "tag" for this process. This process does not explain the primacy effect in the research of Herman Ebbinghaus, but does explain the </strong> recency effect. Cognitive load theory is derived from the limitations of this construct, which is thought to be impaired in ADHD. The process known as "chunking" can enhance this faculty's capacity, which was defined by George Miller's "Magic Number" of seven plus or minus two.

Social Science/None (BHSAT 2013)<br>Two men who tried to meld this man's thought with Marx were Erich Fromm and Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt school. He described a child's pre-religious limitless feeling as the "oceanic feeling," and inspired writings about "displacement," "reaction formation," and other defense mechanisms by his daughter. This author of Civilization and its Discontents related a primitive ban on incest to neurosis in Totem and Taboo. He believed a boy's unconscious had to repress hate for the father to develop a "super-ego" atop the ego and id.

Social Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>A somewhat tweaked version of this experiment done by Sheridan and King used a puppy and found differing results between males and females. The results of this experiment have been explained using the transition from the autonomous state to the agentic state, although other theories discuss the idea of learned helplessness, relating it to the Stanford Prison Experiment. Often used to describe the behavior that occurred at Abu Ghraib prison, it was primarily conducted to determine if the excuse of “just following orders” was justifiable for those who carried out the Holocaust.

Social Science/None (BELLOCO 2014)<br>Susumu Tonegawa activated neurons altered by channelrhodopsin to construct a false form of this phenomenon associated with fear. The Atkinson-Shiffrin model proposes three components of this phenomenon. George Miller described the capacity for one type of this phenomenon as "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two." The journalist "S" exhibited the eidetic form of this concept in a study by Alexander Luria. The anterograde form of one condition is the inability to encode new types of this phenomenon, often because of trauma to the hippocampus. For 10 points, name this mental capacity impaired by amnesia which has sensory, short-term, and long-term varieties.<br>ANSWER: memory<br><br>17. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>This process can be lengthened by a “challenge for cause” or through a “peremptory challenge,” in which no reason needs to be supplied. It can also be lengthened when ensuring moderate views in order to achieve a “death qualification.” If excessive publicity causes this process to be untenable locally, a “change of venue” can be requested.
