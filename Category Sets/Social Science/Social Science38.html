1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>This anthropologist asserted that culture exists to fulfill our basic human needs in The Scientific Theory of Culture. Two of his works deal with "crime and custom" and "sex and repression" in savage society. He also wrote the introduction to a study by his student </strong> Jomo Kenyatta, Facing Mount Kenya. His most famous work discusses the Kula exchange. For 10 points, name this anthropologist, whose works on the Trobriand Islanders include Coral Gardens and their Magic and Argonauts of the Western Pacific.<br>ANSWER: Bronislaw <u>Malinowski</u><br><br>2. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>One chapter in this book attributes the success of the cloth business in its model to the sharpness of the knives and to the “Polish Jew”; that chapter is “The Sweaters of Jewtown.” This book contains a model colored map dividing its subject city into various ethnicities, and notes that the law defines its subject as “occupied by three or more families, living independently and doing their cooking on the premises.” The epilogue of this book attempts one of the earliest programs of subsidized model </strong> housing projects and advocates legislative change to achieve them. For 10 points, identify this early sociological work about immigrants and tenements in New York written by the journalist Jacob Riis.<br>ANSWER: <u>How</u> the <u>Other Half Lives</u>: Studies Among the Tenements in New York<br><br>3. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 11 2009)<br><strong>This author cautioned against "an American society gone awry, training individuals for roles they could not assume," in a work categorizing the Plains Indians as Dionysian and the Zuni as Apollonian. By using war propaganda and the diaries of captured soldiers, this woman categorized </strong> Japanese national character without ever having visited the country. For 10 points, name this anthropologist who wrote Patterns of Culture and who described guilt versus shame cultures in The Chrysanthemum and the Sword.<br>ANSWER: Ruth Fulton <u>Benedict</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Districts 2011)<br>Greek, Latin, and English all use this case to express partitivity. To form this case on a Russian masculine noun, one must replace any trailing ee krot-KOY-eh with YAH and add "a" (AH). In German, it is marked by the articles "einer," "eines," "des," and "der" and known as “der Wesfall.” For 10 points, identify this case, which is often translated using the word “of” and is used to express possession.<br>ANSWER: <u>genitive</u> case<br><br>5. Social Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>This man argued that state-licensing requirements restricted entry into the medical field, inflating doctors’ salaries. He proposed that Keynesian economics cause stagflation in a work he wrote with his wife entitled Free to Choose. He also suggested the people always spend the same percentage of their income on consumption in A Theory of the Consumption Function. This man also posited that consumers base their economic decisions on [*] expected future income rather than current income in his “permanent income hypothesis.” For 10 points, identify this Chicago school economist who authored A Monetary History of the United States and Capitalism and Freedom.<br>ANSWER: Milton <u>Friedman</u><br><br>6. Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2010)<br>This thinker argued that the German Empire was better able to utilize modern technology than Democratic France and Britain and posited a growing conflict between improving industrial processes and the means of making money. This author of Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution also claimed that the social Darwinist outlook was an evolutionary remnant of prehistoric, barbarian survivalism and introduced the concept of "conspicuous consumption". For 10 points, name this Norwegian-American economist who wrote The Theory of Business Enterprise and The Theory of the Leisure Class.<br>ANSWER: Thorstein Veblen<br><br>7. Social Science/All (HAVOC 2008)<br>This theory was developed in 1912 by the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener,  and the findings of Eduard Suess helped support it. Suess concluded, mainly as a  result of fossil evidence, that a land mass containing several present continents  existed in the south in the Jurassic period. This mass was named Gondwanaland, and  broke apart into smaller plates according to a related theory developed in the 1960’s.  FTP, name this theory related to plate tectonics which states that continents float  atop a liquid layer of the earth.<br>ANSWER: Continental Drift (do not accept plate tectonics)<br><br>8. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>Book V of The Wealth of Nations primarily discusses this concept. The Pigouvian variety is employed when individual and societal marginal cost curves are not equivalent, and “farming” related to this concept arguably led to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. Other historical examples include jizya and Danegeld. Milton Friedman argued for a negative variety of this cause of deadweight loss. Laffer curve plots its rate on the x-axis, and supply-side economists advocate lowering it in order to stimulate growth. For 10 points, progressive and regressive are two types of what primary source of revenue for the government?<br>ANSWER: <u>tax</u> [accept word forms]<br><br>9. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>It is largely the work of J.J. Cambaceres, and its final draft was divided into three main sections: “Of Persons,” “Of Property and Different Modifications of Property,” and “Of the Different Modes of Acquiring Property.” Heavily influenced by the Corpus Juris Civilis, it was instituted in 1804 and is still used in modified form in Quebec and Louisiana. For 10 points, identify this document governing civil law put forth by a namesake Emperor of France.<br>ANSWER: <u>Code Napoleon</u> [accept <u>Napoleonic Code</u> or reasonable equivalents]<br><br>10. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 2 2008)<br>In an Evans-Pritchard work that is set "Among the Nuer," this principle is contrasted with political associations. This word is the last in the title of a 1949 book that developed the alliance theory, and was written by Levi-Strauss. Its terminology was developed by Lewis Henry Morgan, who included Iroquois and Crow as examples of bifurcate merging. Godparents are often an example of the fictive type, and it can be shown with a genealogy diagram. For 10 points, name this relation between persons that is often based on marriage or common ancestry.<br>ANSWER: kinship [accept "family relationships" or other equivalents only before the end of the<br><br>11. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>One type of this was measured on the "F-scale" in a book which found that "anti-intraception," superstition, and obsession with sex and power comprised its "authoritarian" type. Histrionic, dependent, and schizoid are among the types of disorders that can affect it. Tests which attempt to categorize this include the TAT and the Minnesota-developed </strong> MMPI. Another test divides it into sixteen "types" based on such qualities as "judgment" and "introversion." For 10 points, a Myers-Briggs test evaluates what thing, the sum of an individual's behavioral characteristics?<br>ANSWER: personality<br><br>12. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>In an oligopoly situation, the curve measuring this quantity has a unique kinked shape. Increase in price of complementary goods lowers this quantity. For Veblen goods, an increase in price </strong> increases this quantity. The Slutsky Equation relates compensated and uncompensated varieties of this quantity, named after Hicks and Marshall, respectively. Keynes did extensive work on its "aggregate" form. For 10 points, identify this economic concept, which describes a willingness and ability to pay for a product, and is often contrasted with supply.<br>ANSWER: demand<br><br>13. Social Science/None (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>This man's vision of modernity featured a transition from traditional and charismatic power to rational-legal power in the form of bureaucracy. This thinker denied the possibility of true Christian morals in government and defined the state as the entity with monopoly on legitimate use of force in Politics as a Vocation. He developed the concept of the iron cage of rationality to describe the dehumanizing effect of over-rationalization in a work which argues that Calvinist influences led people in certain countries to work harder and lead their own enterprises. For 10 points, name this German sociologist who wrote The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.<br>ANSWER: (Maximilian Karl Emil) "Max" Weber<br><br>14. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>The Duggan-Schwarz theorem applies this concept's mechanism to yield a set of results rather than a single one, and Holmstrom's theorem adapts it for competitive firms. Further generalized as the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, this idea was updated in 1963 with the addition of Pareto efficiency to its criteria; those criteria also include the independence of </strong> irrelevant alternatives and consideration of universality. First described in Social Choice and Individual Values, it concerns a fair voting system taking every person's choice into account. For 10 points, name this “impossibility theorem” named for the winner of the 1972 Nobel Prize in Economics.<br>ANSWER: <u>Arrow's</u> impossibility theorem [or <u>Arrow's paradox</u>; or the <u>general possibility</u> theorem]<br><br>15. Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>This man cited improved efficiency of airframe production and the Horndal iron works in an article outlining his "learning by doing" growth model. This man proved an equilibrium would exist in a perfectly competitive economy. That general equilibrium model is named for him and Gerard Debreu. He argued lack of information and moral hazard made health care especially prone to market failure in "Uncertainty and the Welfare Economics of Medical Care." Another theorem by this man shows there will always exist a decisive </strong> voter with dictatorial powers under conditions like unanimity and independence of irrelevant alternatives. For 10 points, name this economist who showed the difficulty of a democratic social welfare function in his impossibility theorem.<br>ANSWER: Kenneth Arrow<br><br>16. Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>This person worked with David Himmelstein on a study which claimed that half of personal bankruptcies follow medical problems. This former chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel that investigated the Troubled Asset Relief Program was passed over in favor of Richard Cordray to head the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she worked to implement. She recently gained press attention for stating, “There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own.” Name this Harvard Law professor now campaigning to replace Scott Brown as US Senator from Massachusetts.<br>ANSWER: Elizabeth Warren<br><br>17. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>A conversation between this person and James Baldwin on the title subject was transcribed in the book A Rap on Race. This writer’s most influential work was challenged by Derek Freeman as "an anthropological myth," claiming that this person had little familiarity with the namesake ethnic group's language, and that she had erroneously depicted their community on Tau Island as an ideal paradise. For 10 points, name this anthropologist and writer of Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies and Coming of Age in Samoa.<br>ANSWER: Margaret <u>Mead</u><br><br>18. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>This scenario was used to model the evolution of reciprocal altruism in a 1971 paper by Robert Trivers. Proposed by Merril Flood and Melvin Dresher, this scenario tends to be defined by the conditions T greater than R greater than P greater than S, though related variants relax some of those conditions. A tournament of its iterated variant was proposed by Robert </strong> Axelrod and won by Anatol Rapoport’s “tit for tat” strategy. For 10 points, name this zero-sum problem of game theory, whose title characters must agree either to stick to their story or to rat each other out.<br>ANSWER: <u>prisoner’s dilemma</u><br><br>19. Social Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 2 2008)<br>Joseph Schumpeter introduced a paradox stating that this law is trivially easy to understand, but no one understands it. An early form of it was stated by Theognis in his Maxims, and it was first attributed to its namesake, an adviser to Elizabeth I, by H. D. Macleod. One stipulation of this law is that the entities involved in it must exchange for the same price. This law was analyzed by David Hume in “On the Balance of Trade,” in a section discussing the introduction of paper currency. For 10 points, name this law that colloquially states, “Bad money drives out the good.”<br>ANSWER: <u>Gresham's</u> Law<br><br>20.
