Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>In corporate finance, these things create a namesake "shield," which enables companies to increase their value by taking on more debt. Consumers might not respond to current changes in these things because they take future government actions into account, according to a theory promoted by Robert Barro known as "equivalence." The </strong> burden of these things falls more heavily on the more inelastic actor in a supply and demand chart, where these things form a "wedge" between the two curves. Negative externalities can be resolved by the "Pigouvian" variety of these policies. According to the controversial Laffer Curve, lessening the burden of these policies may counterintuitively increase government revenue.

Social Science/None (NASAT 2015)<br>Kenneth Arrow and John Pratt developed a measure of how people react to this thing based on the ratio of the utility function's second derivative over its first derivative. Individuals whose behavior can be explained by a linear utility function are indifferent towards it. Beta is the ratio of this quantity for a specific asset over this quantity of the entire market. Its price for a given portfolio is the expected excess return of the portfolio over its standard deviation. Frank Knight treated this quantity as something measurable to distinguish it from uncertainty. The variance of an asset's return is used to measure this thing, which treasury bonds are usually assumed to be free of.
