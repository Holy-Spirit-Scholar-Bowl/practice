That book was written in 1962 by Michael Harrington.

The author of the first study that demonstrated this phenomenon, James Vicary, claimed it was a hoax. A follow-up experiment on this subject by the Canadian Broadcasting Company showed that people reported being hungry and thirsty despite the CBC flashing the words "Call Now" 352 times, instead of anything to do with eating or drinking.

For 10 points, name this psychological effect often named for Kitty Genovese that states that people are less likely to help others while part of a large group than when they are alone.<br>ANSWER: <u>bystander</u> effect<br><br>5. Social Science/All (BDAT I 2011)<br><strong>One version of this process uses the concept of public and private keys, where a public key is considered common knowledge and a private key is known only to the individual; that is the RSA type. Keys are used to send messages that are obscured by the public key and can only be </strong> read by the holder of the private key.  The algorithms used for its are typically referred to as ciphers and some notable ones include Cesaer and Vernam.

Social Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q 1 2008)<br>This concept was linked to the paranoid-schizoid position by Melanie Klein, and Otto Rank believed in the importance of a stage before it. It was explored in the case study of a boy who feared horses, “Little Hans,” and this concept was posited as an explanation for the creation of the super-ego, as subjects internalize their fear of castration.

John Maynard Smith developed the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy using work in this field. This field was initially developed to analyze situations in which one party does better at another’s expense, called [*] zero-sum. In this field, a “stag hunt” is a situation that has a conflict between safety and cooperation and the idea that each player's strategy is the best response to the strategies played by his rivals is central to this field and is known as Nash equilibrium.

This author of Biology and Knowledge wrote about a two-fold process of juvenile moral development in The Moral Judgment of the Child. He also gave a name to our understanding that, when something disappears from view, it isn't really gone. Besides “object permanence”, this psychologist formulated a theory with stages like preoperational and sensorimotor, which are differentiated by their development of schema.
