1. Social Science/All (BDAT I 2011)<br><strong>This thinker wrote about “The Vision of Zosimos” in his work discussing the Tao. In that work, he associated water with the spirit. He also predicted that mandalas led to individuation and coined a term meaning two unrelated events happening simultaneously, “synchronicity.” The work by this author of </strong> Psychological Types on two personality types was a forerunner to the Myer- Briggs test. He proposed the sage, shadow, and animus as some of his archetypes. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist who coined the terms introvert and extrovert and hypothesized that all humans share a collective unconscious.<br>ANSWER: Carl Gustav <u>Jung</u> [pronounced YOONG]<br><br>2. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 17 2011)<br><strong>This man proposed a theoretical framework called “principles and parameters,” and he reduced transformations to the operation “move alpha” before reducing them further to “internal Merge.” He criticized behaviorist views of language in a review of B.F. Skinner’s work Verbal Behavior.

Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2009)<br>Vocabulary  This adjective describes languages in which inflectional forms are more important than word order. Rationalists believe that these types of propositions can be a priori, while empiricists claim that they cannot be. A proposition of this type is true or untrue based on facts about the world.

Name this term that also describes fibers such as nylon and polyester that are different than natural fibers.<br>ANSWER: Synthetic(al)<br><br>4. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regionals 2011)<br>A recent ruling against this legislation was criticized for its neglect of the Necessary and Proper Clause. McDonald's was issued a waiver for its hourly employees under this legislation, and the Congressional Budget Office has claimed this law will cut $143 billion from the federal deficit by 2020. It will allow for the creation of high-risk pools, and already mandates an 80 percent medical loss ratio for insurers. It also allows children to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>Along with Chenery, this man introduced a special case production function that applies when the substitution effect is continually elastic. He later collaborated with Gerard Debreu to write a paper which proved the existence of a competitive equilibrium, which was crucial for GET. This author of The Limits of Organization later wrote Social Choice and Individual </strong> Values, in which he advanced a theorem which can be extended with the addition of Pareto Optimality as a necessary condition. For 10 points, name this economist who posited that an intransitive social preference could not be derived from a set of transitive preferences, called his “Impossibility Theorem.”<br>ANSWER: Kenneth <u>Arrow</u><br><br>6. Social Science/None (Masonic 2014)<br>Along with the Chief Justice, the holder of this post is an ex oficio Regent of the Smithsonian. Following presidential elections, this officeholder is officially responsible for presiding over the counting of votes in front of Congress, though the President Pro Tempore [TEM-poh-ree] sometimes carries out that function. The holder of this post breaks ties in the Senate, as he is the acting President of that chamber. Until the 12th Amendment was passed, this position went to the runner-up in an election.

Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>These animals are poisoned to provide an answer to an oracle during the benge ritual, which is described in Evans-Pritchard's book Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Azande. An ethnographer observing these animals imagines that a crowd functions as a super-organism when it shouts "pulisi! pulisi!" and distinguishes gambling for status or money in a sport involving these animals. Thick description is used to describe the </strong> fights between these animals in Bali in Clifford Geertz's essay "Deep Play." Metal spurs are often attached to these animals' feet in staged fights. This most common livestock animal was domesticated in Southeast Asia from the red junglefowl.

Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Districts 2011)<br>Some economists claim that this concept is obsolete because factors of production can be relocated. This theory was popularized by the author of Political Economy and Taxation, and it states that trade partners should specialize in processes for which they have lower opportunity costs. David Ricardo used an example involving Portuguese wine and English cloth to demonstrate this concept. For 10 points, name this concept that shows that countries can benefit from trade despite having absolute advantage in production.<br>ANSWER: <u>comparative</u> advantage<br><br>9. Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>Geoffrey MacCormack criticized this thinker for his imprecision in conflating the "personality" of an object with a Maori term called the "hau". He wrote an essay describing actions which are "effective and traditional", including walking and positioning the hands at rest, that he called "body techniques". That essay by this man inspired Norbert Elias's later work on habitus. His most famous book describes a concept which is imbued with "spiritual mechanisms", the most notable of which is reciprocity, in a phenomenon he called </strong> "total prestation". That book by this man employs Malinowski's analysis of the kula ring, which he compares to the potlatch system of exchanging the title objects. For 10 points, name this nephew of Emile Durkheim who wrote The Gift.<br>ANSWER: Marcel Mauss<br><br>10. Social Science/None (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>Robert J. Barro attempted to elaborate on David Ricardo's proposal that these entities and loans are interchangeable because consumers internalize budget constraints. That idea is the Barro-Ricardo equivalence theorem. An alternative to one of these entities designed to correct a negative externality created by Arthur Pigou is a cap-and-trade system. When introduced into an equilibrated market, they can cause deadweight loss by driving a "wedge" between consumers and producers. For 10 points, name these entities that come in Pigovian, estate, value added, sales, and income varieties, a percentage of a transaction that goes to the government.<br>ANSWER: taxes [Accept any kinds of taxes, like Pigovian taxes, income taxes, or sales taxes.]<br><br>11.

Social Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>This theory was popularized in the book Social Choice and Individual Values, and won its namesake the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1972. This theory assumes that a preference order must be extracted on a given set of options and states that monotonicity, non-imposition, and independence of irrelevant alternatives together imply Pareto efficiency. This theorem states that [*] universality, non-dictatorship, monotonicity, non-imposition, and independence of irrelevant alternatives are not all attainable by a single voting system with at least two voters and three options.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>One dissent in this case argued that the majority’s approach would have extended constitutional protections to the broadcasts of Tokyo Rose.

Social Science/None (NTSS 2013)<br>The ability of an industry with this condition to bring this condition to other industries is known as Baxter's law. The Pacman conjecture and Coase conjecture are competing theories about whether or not price competition exists under this condition that can be created by patents. There is often political debate over the existence of what are called "natural" types of these for companies such as utilities, and an important court case on this subject was United States v. AT&T.
