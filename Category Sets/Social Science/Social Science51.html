1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>This theory was modified by Clayton Alderfer in his essay "Existence, Relatedness, and Growth." Put forth in Toward a Psychology of Being, its creator studied "exemplary people" such as Eleanor Roosevelt. Typically represented pictorially by a </strong> pyramid, its originator claims that lower levels must be reached before one can begin to reach higher levels. Its highest level is achieved when one becomes all he is capable of being and is known as self-actualization. For 10 points, name this organization of human requirements first postulated by Abraham Maslow.<br>ANSWER: Maslow's hierarchy of needs<br><br>2. Social Science/None (Masonic 2014)<br>In a case involving National Bellas Hess, the Supreme Court ruled that a substantial nexus had to be established in order to enforce one of these.

Social Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>Because of social isolation, Walpiri women have a better command of one kind of these than Walpiri men. Tab, dez, and sig are the three features of the notational system developed by William Stokoe, who showed that they contain minimal pairs. The one that developed spontaneously in a Nicaraguan school is an isolate, and that indigenous to Martha's Vineyard has now died out. The Israeli one achieves prosody by incorporating facial expressions, while the Thai one is a creole with ASL. Koko the gorilla was taught, FTP, what kind of language used by the deaf?<br>ANSWER: <u>sign languages</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>John Sununu replaced Judd Gregg in a group overseeing this program, which has been criticized for not utilizing XBRL. Inspector General Eric Thorson has been highly critical of that group, which supervises the use of P-PIP and ranks subjects by CAMELS ratings. Herbert Allison may soon succeed Neel Kashkari as the head of the Office of Financial Stability, a division created along with this initiative, which will focus on CDOs and other highly liquid targets. For 10 points, identify government initiative aimed at promoting market stability by purchasing volatile assets.<br>ANSWER: Troubled <u>Asset Relief</u> Program<br><br>5. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring 2012)<br>IBNS is a system that attempts to prevent crime involving this construct. Georg Simmel's work on the philosophy of this construct explains that it helps individuals understand the totality of life. This construct avoids the problem of the "double coincidence of wants" an economy without it encounters. Measurements of the supply of this construct differ depending on the liquidity of its various types. In modern times, this construct's value may be due to fiat; but in general this must be a store of value and a medium of exchange. For 10 points, name this term used to measure wealth, commonly expressed with dollar bills.<br>ANSWER: <u>Money</u> [accept currency, prompt on "dollars," "legal tender," or "cash"]<br><br>6. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2007)<br><strong>Daryl Bem has proposed self-perception theory as an alternative to this concept, which can be understood using the Free-choice Paradigm and the Belief-Disconfirmation Paradigm. Evidence about it was collected in an experiment in which subjects performed boring tasks and were told to lie about them to others. Its central tenet is that paired ideas can and do </strong> conflict, motivating one to avoid information about either idea in order to bring both in harmony. FTP, name this psychological phenomenon developed by Leon Festinger that describes the condition of turmoil resulting from inconsistency between a person's actions and beliefs.<br>ANSWER: <u>cognitive dissonance</u><br><br>7. Social Science/All (Fall Novice 2009)<br>Cost-push inflation occurs when the basic price rises while this value falls. Calculated using either the income or expenditure approach, its namesake “deflator” includes producer goods as well as government-purchased goods and services. Its “net” form can be found by subtracting capital depreciation from this value. Unlike its counterpart, it does not account for investments by foreigners nor investments held by natives in other countries. For 10 points, identify this measure of economic growth abbreviated as GDP.<br>ANSWER: <u>Gross Domestic Product</u> [must give full answer at end]<br><br>8. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>Matteo Ricci was one of many missionaries who invented writing systems for this language.

Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2010)<br>A "revolution" in the theory of this concept claims that it doesn't require regulation when entry cost is low. Hotelling's law states that it is sometimes advantageous to consumers, and natural ones arise due to economies of scale. In these situations, profit is maximized when marginal cost equals marginal revenue, which results in inefficiency due to deadweight loss. It is characterized by high barriers to entry and no close substitutes to a given product. For 10 points, name this market structure in which there is only one provider of a good or service.<br>ANSWER: <u>monopoly</u> [accept word forms]<br><br>10. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>A "prisoner's dilemma" situation can determine their level under an oligopoly, and companies which cannot affect their general level are "takers" of these. Thorstein Veblen advocated technocracy in a book about "The Engineers and" the "system" of these. Market segmentation is one reason for their namesake "discrimination." In basic economic graphs, demand increases, and supply decreases, as these rise. For 10 points, what are these values, which are often plotted against quantity on supply-demand graphs, and which rise in periods of inflation?<br>ANSWER: prices [or the price level; do not accept "costs"]<br><br>11. Social Science/All (Delta Burke 2003)<br>John McWhorter, in his Afrogenesis Hypothesis, argued that they were imported from West African trading stations. The Substrate Hypothesis argues they are a result of nearly complete relexification while Derek Bickerton’s Bioprogram Hypothesis says that first generations created them with the same innate means by which all first languages are acquired. Examples include the Saramaccan of Suriname, the Papiamento of Curacao, and the Gullah of South Carolina. FTP this describes what kind of language defined as a pidgin which has become a native language and named for the French spoken in Haiti.<br>ANSWER: <u>Creole</u> Languages (prompt on “pidgin” until “first generations in 3rd line).<br><br>12. Social Science/All (Fall Novice 2009)<br>This man developed a theory which attempts to predict the formation of grammatically correct sentences, and that theory is known as generative grammar. This man also published the book Syntactic Structures, which contains his idea of transformational grammar. To create a completely nonsensical phrase with correct grammar, this man coined the sentence “colorless green ideas sleep furiously.” For 10 points, name this MIT linguist and leftist political commentator.<br>ANSWER: Avram Noam <u>Chomsky</u><br><br>13. Social Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>In his A Key into the Language of America, this thinker showed that he was one of the first Europeans to undertake a scholarly study of various Native American tribal languages. Later he wrote his most important tract, The Bloody Tenant.  Earlier in his life, he chafed at Archbishop William Laud’s strict control of Anglican Church doctrine, escaping with his wife Mary to Boston. Due to his prior religious training, he was immediately invited to become a pastor, but refused the job and was eventually exiled, for he believed that civic authorities should exercise no power over one’s own religious convictions. For ten points, name this notable advocate of religious tolerance and founder of the colony of Rhode Island.<br>ANSWER: Roger Williams<br><br>14. Social Science/All (Crusader Cup 2005)<br>Extra Toss-Up #2  This work claimed that slavery was uneconomical because the cost of maintaining slaves was greater than using free workers and that the plantation system was a wasteful use of land. It is better known for defending a laissez- faire system by suggesting that an invisible hand led people who sought their own good to act in ways best for all. For ten points, identify this 1776 political economic treatise by Adam Smith.<br>ANSWER: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the <u>Wealth of Nations</u><br><br>15. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>Robert Putnam talked about the decline of the “social” type of this resource in Bowling Alone. This concept names a work which introduced the idea of “commodity fetishism”, and along with land and labor, it is one of the factors of production in classical economics. Startup firms can benefit from the “venture” form of this.

For 10 points, name this woman who wrote Coming of Age in Samoa.<br>ANSWER: Margaret <u>Mead</u><br><br>17. Social Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>In one of this man’s works, he determined that he had previously mistranslated the word “numaym” as “clan,”  instead of “a bundle of privileges.” This man distinguished between historical and geographic sciences in his work The Study of Geography. This man wrote about his study of Inuits on Baffin Island in his book The Central Eskimo, and he tutored Alfred Kroeber. His best known work advanced his concept of cultural relativism and was entitled The Mind of Primitive Man. For 10 points, name this man who taught many other anthropologists at Columbia University and was called “the Father of American Anthropology.”<br>ANSWER: Franz Boas<br><br>18. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>This work's examination of child-rearing was revisited in The Anatomy of Dependence, which posited “amae” as an explanation for this work's central questions. Clifford Geertz likened this work to a satire by Jonathan Swift, and it has been criticized for the unusual experiences of a case study named Robert. This work describes it subjects as “debtor[s] to the ages” and includes a section on the regularity of gardens. This work posits a complex system of </strong> debt-repayment that underlies society and describes the importance of “clearing one's name” in a section about self-denial for the sake of duty, dubbed giri.
