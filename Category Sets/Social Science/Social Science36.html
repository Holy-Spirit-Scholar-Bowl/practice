He claimed that Socrates's independence of thought rendered a service to humanity in his On the Normality of Crime, and that specialization of labor leads to evolution from mechanical to organic solidarity.

One study of this phenomenon included a set of 2,300 consonant-vowel-consonant nonsense syllables. This phenomenon, which can occur due to proactive or retroactive interference, is prevented by the primacy, recency, and serial position effects, and was modeled by an exponential decrease in Hermann Ebbinghaus's curve.
