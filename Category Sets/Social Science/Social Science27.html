Social Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>In one theorem, if trade in this entity is possible and there are no transaction costs, bargaining leads to an efficient outcome regardless of previous allocation; that theorem is named for Coase. The positional type of this concept can lead to conspicuous consumption, and, in its presence, social costs and benefits are introduced into the supply-demand diagram. Pigovian taxes and subsidies are often used to minimize or maximize it, which can be caused by either pollution or education. For 10 points, identify this economic concept in which a third party is affected by production or consumption of a commodity.<br>ANSWER: <u>externalities</u> or <u>spillover</u><br><br>4.

This work asserts that wants are increasingly created by the process by which they are satisfied in its formulation of the "dependence effect". Arguing that the government should shift its resources to improving infrastructure and social services, this work criticizes the "conventional wisdom" of American policies and attacks the notion of "consumer sovereignty". For 10 points, name this book describing America's wastefulness despite a wealth in private resources written by John Kenneth Galbraith.<br>ANSWER: The Affluent Society<br><br>6. Social Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>This idea was expanded upon with Clayton Alderfer's ERG theory and one aspect of it can be tested with John Curtis Gowan's Northridge Developmental Scale. Norwood used this theory to propose that humans can seek coping and helping information, while William James proposed a similar version which stated material, social and spiritual levels. First proposed in a 1943 paper titled A Theory in Human Motivation, one of its levels had earlier been introduced by Kurt Goldstein and it states that factors like food and safety must be satisfied before more complex desires like self-esteem and confidence are met. FTP, identify this psychological concept whose seventh level is self-actualization, an idea proposed by Abraham Maslow. <br>ANSWER: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs<br><br>7. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>The sociologist Ernest Burgess used this city’s growth patterns as the basis for his “concentric zone model.” The CEO of this city’s public school system, Arne Duncan, was appointed Secretary of Education by Barack Obama.

Social Science/All (QuAC I 2008)<br>He argued for an organic long-run model of culture change in his posthumous “inquiry into race relations in Africa”, The Dynamics of Culture Change. This man's dictum that “speech is a mode of action, not a countersign of thought” has been used by anthropologist Robin Roberts to suggest he is the founder of the sub-field of cultural pragmatics. He is acknowledged as the founder of anthropological functionalism, which he applied to his study of the Kula Ring Exchange in the Trobriand Islands.

Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Gerald Cohen's analytic approach to his philosopher's theory of history was a reaction against the vagueness of Louis Althusser's interpretation of this man's work. This man sketched out the plan for a multi-volume work and introduced the notion of "surplus value" in his sprawling Grundrisse. He criticized the SDAP political platform, which was based on the ideas of Ferdinand Lassalle, in a letter which states </strong> "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need." This author of Critique of the Gotha Program proposed that a certain type of system divides society into a base and a superstructure, and wrote that class struggle will lead to a transitional dictatorship of the proletariat.

Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>This school's name was coined by Christian von Ehrenfels. This school believes in the “common fate” principle and had its ideas extended to a school of therapy by Fritz Perls. Its theories, which were also applied to behavioral science by Kurt Lewin (luh-VEEN), are embodied in its fundamental law of “clarity” or “pragnanz.” This school originally investigated why a light on a series of bulbs appears to be “moving,” calling that the phi phenomenon, and was led by Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Kohler, and Max Wertheimer (VAIRT-high-mer). For 10 points, identify this school of psychology which theorized that the brain makes a “completion” of all sensory stimuli and is named after the German word for “whole.”<br>ANSWER: <u>Gestalt</u> psychology<br><br>12. Social Science/None (SCOP Novice 2013)<br><strong>A treatise on this subject by Jean-Jacques Rousseau details how the boy Emile experiences this.

Social Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XVI 2008)<br>|      In one section of this work, the author demonstrates the difference between real value and nominal value by equating various items in terms of both yards of linen and ounces of gold. In Part III, the author discusses the labor process and the valorization process, and divides the titular entity into constant and variable types. Originally planned as three volumes, only the first was completed in the author’s lifetime. The central goal of this work was to explain capitalism and the class struggle behind it.

Social Science/All (Crusader Cup 2005)<br>Toss-Up #14  First studied by Edward Thorndike, this behavior modification technique is also called instrumental learning. Thorndike theorized that successful responses were stamped in and ineffective ones stamped out through experience. Unlike the Pavlovian type which occurs regardless of outcome, this technique is explained by its results and satisfaction. Thus, rats will press bars to receive food or stop pressing to avoid shocks. For ten points, identify this behavioral technique often associated with B.F. Skinner.<br>ANSWER: <u>Operant Conditioning</u><br><br>15. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>One work by this founder of the school of institutional economics expressed his desire that the rule of technocrats would replace corporate power. This author of The Engineers and the Price System names products like caviar, diamonds, and luxury cars as examples of his namesake </strong> goods that have a positively-sloped demand curve. Another of his works contains a chapter on "The Belief in Luck" and discusses a group that practices pecuniary emulation and conspicuous consumption.

Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>This two-word phrase was introduced in 1919 by Upton Sinclair, whose book The Brass Check uses it to describe the "petty underlings" of a certain kind of world. According to a 1951 book, people described by this phrase do not "live by making things;" instead they handle "paper and money and people." That book, which describes the "salesmanship mentality" among the "American Middle Classes," is by </strong> C. Wright Mills and is named for this phrase.
