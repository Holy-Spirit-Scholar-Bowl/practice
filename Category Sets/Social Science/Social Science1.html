1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 15 2011)<br><strong>An important critique of this work was published five years after its author’s death and asserts that much of this work was based on the made-up stories of two teenagers; that critique is by </strong> Derek Freeman.

Social Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>It can be applied to argue for the existence of God, and recent studies have connected it to algorithm information theory. This principle was first demonstrated in Maimonides _The Guide for the Perplexed_; however, its namesake, the writer of Summa Logicae, was probably the first to put it to use. J. J. Smart championed this principle in his article, "Sensations and Brain Processes", and philosophers such as Immanuel Kant and Walter Chatton argued against it. In the modern day, it is commonly used as a goal for all doctors to strive toward; however, Hickam's dictum argues against it, stating that patients can have as many diseases as they please. FTP, name this principle, stating that, all other things held equal, the simplest explanation is the most likely to be correct.<br>ANSWER: <u>Occam's razor</u> (accept law of parsimony, simplicity, anything that seems<br><br>4. Social Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>In a work most famous in his own lifetime, this man advocated the idea that some forms had disappeared from certain languages, a theory born out in his study of Hittite.

Social Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>This author defined the title concept as “relative to sacred things” that are set apart and forbidden and argued that emotional security leads to the development of religion in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Another work by this thinker defines the field of sociology as one that analyzes “social facts”, while another of his works differentiates </strong> mechanical and organic solidarity. In addition to writing The Rules of the Sociological Method and Division of Labour in Society, he concluded that a greater “social control” amongst Catholics decreased their chances of the title action. For ten points, name this French sociologist that divided the title phenomenon into altruistic, fatalistic, egoistic, and anomic types in Suicide.<br>ANSWER: David Émile <u>Durkheim</u><br><br>6. Social Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>This concept’s namesake curve slopes downward because of the Mundell-Fleming exchange-rate effect, Pigou’ s wealth effect, and Keynes’ interest rate effect.

Social Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>John Geanakoplos wrote three brief proofs of it, and an extension of it applying to single winners is known as the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem. A later version of this idea implements Pareto efficiency instead of non-imposition and monotonicity. Its criteria include unrestricted domain and non-dictatorship, and it states that in the presence of three or more options, there is no consistent method to construct social preferences from individual ones. Described in Social Choice and Individual Values, for 10 points, name this theorem from social choice theory formulated by a co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics with Alfred Hicks.<br>ANSWER: <u>Arrow's impossibility</u> theorem [accept <u>Arrow's paradox</u>]<br><br>8.

Name these speech sounds, of which there are 21 in the Roman alphabet.<br>ANSWER: consonants<br><br>9. Social Science/All (Fall Novice 2009)<br>“The History of Astronomy” is one of his Essays on Philosophical Subjects, and another work by this man talks about “different progress of opulence” and “the nature, accumulation, and employment of stock” and includes a parable about a butcher, baker, and brewer, whose self-interests promote general welfare.

Social Science/All (From Here To Eternity 2009)<br>They are classified as symmetric or asymmetric if the identities of people involved do not matter. John Maynard Smith applied the principles behind these entities into the Evolution of Sex, while  John Von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern studied them.

Social Science/All (MW GSAC XVII 2009)<br>In one work, this man argued that natural feelings of sympathy and conscience established a natural regulation of beneficial social patterns. In addition to The Theory of Moral Sentiments, he wrote another work in which he formulated an early version of Ricardo's law of rent and analyzed the division of labor in a pin factory. That work proposes land, labor, and capital as the three factors of production and proposed an “invisible hand” governing laissez-faire economies.

Social Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>In one work, this author examines the tribes of Arapesh, Mundugumor, and Tchambuli and studies the link between sexual characteristics and cultural conditioning.

Social Science/None (BHSAT 2016)<br><strong>Daniel Bernoulli's resolution to the St. Petersburg Paradox involved introducing this quantity, and exponential models of this concept assume risk is constant. Kahneman and Tversky developed prospect theory to improve on theories based on the </strong> ​"expected" form of this concept.

One form of this quantity constitutes the Y axis of the IS-LM model and another form constitutes that of the macroeconomic money market. The "real" form of this quantity equals the nominal one minus the expected rate of inflation, and when policies targeting these are ineffective, a </strong> liquidity trap occurs.
