1. Social Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>This man expanded up on his essay “The Paradox of Saving” in Prices and Production, and he described how only a benevolent planner can achieve a rational economic order using perfect information in his essay The Use of Knowledge in Society. He argued that the title belief cannot stop development from occurring and differentiated that belief from liberalism, though his best known work discusses the evolution of totalitarianism in socialist states and compares the USSR to Nazi Germany. For 10 points, identify this author of Why I am not a Convervative and The Road to Serfdom.<br>ANSWER: Freidrich von <u>Hayek</u><br><br>2. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>At efficiency in the Keynesian Cross, this equals the total output of an economy. An externality is beneficial if the social type of this is higher than the private type. A Giffen Good has an upward sloping curve that measures this, while Say's law states that this is created by the presence of a good. Price elasticity is computed by dividing change in price over change in this variable, which can be measured as an individual's marginal utility for consumption of a good. For 10 points, identify this measurement of desire for a good, often paired with supply.<br>ANSWER: demand [accept aggregate demand before "Giffen Good" is read]<br><br>3. Social Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>This man opposed the Poor Laws, and unlike most of his contemporaries, supported the Corn Laws, believing that they would increase domestic production by discouraging importation. He defined rent as the surplus created by the difference between the most and least productive land in one work, and criticized Say's law in another. Along with An Inquiry Into the Nature and Progress of Rent and his 1820 work Principles of Political Economy, his best-known work argues that war, famine, and pestilence would result from the population increasing geometrically while food supply increases arithmetically.

Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2010)<br>One advocate of this school of thought analyzed mand, tact, and echoic varieties of language, which he described in terms of its formal and functional properties.

Skinner.<br>ANSWER: Behaviorism<br><br>6. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 15 2011)<br><strong>This man sent packages to random individuals in Omaha and Wichita with instructions to send to targets in Boston, in a study which attempted to calcuate the average path length of social networks.

For 10 points, name this psychologist best known for his namesake obedience experiment.<br>ANSWER: Stanley <u>Milgram</u><br><br>7. Social Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XVI 2008)<br>|  Work with Harlow’s rhesus monkeys spurred his thoughts on “instinctoid” homeostasis while his reading of Kurt Goldstein’s Organism led to his growth motivation concept, obtained by people such as Abraham Lincoln, who were susceptible to “metapathologies” and attempted to fulfill “metaneeds.” This man also studied transpersonal psychology, which he called the “fourth force” in the sequence from Freudian to Behaviorism to his own movement. FTP, name this author of Motivation and Personality and Towards a Psychology of Being, the humanistic psychologist who developed a namesake “hierarchy of needs.”          |<br>ANSWER: Abraham <u>Maslow</u><br><br>8. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This system inspired subsequent projects such as Louis Couturat's Ido and Otto Jespersen's Novial.

Social Science/All (Maryland Spring 2012)<br>Bertram Forer used a fake analysis of this concept to demonstrate the PT Barnum effect, while the case of Phineas Gage provided early evidence for its biological basis. Cattell defined this concept in terms of its ability to predict behavior, while Allport's trait theory of this concept held that certain traits were central and others were secondary. The most widely accepted theory of this concept is the Big Five, and Carl Jung's theory on this property was developed into a four part scale by Myers and Briggs. For 10 points, name this property of a person that might include traits like extroversion or agreeableness.<br>ANSWER: <u>Personality</u><br><br>10. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>A fundamental disagreement between Keynesian and monetarist economics is the question of what this value is for the LM curve; for Keynesians it is very high, but for monetarists it is nearly zero. The "arc" kind of this quantity eliminates biases caused by the choice of the start point in the traditional formula for the "cross" kind of it, which measures the relationship between one good's price and the demand for a second good. Goods which one cannot live without have a low value of this quantity. For 10 points, identify this economic quantity that measures how much some curve, such as demand, can change in response to various conditions.<br>ANSWER: elasticity<br><br>11. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>Arabic terms for this object include the specific "al-yamin" and the more general "yed." Latin also has specific words for types of this object, including "sinistra." The Greek word for it, "kheir," gives rise to the chemistry term "chiral."

Social Science/All (QuAC I 2008)<br>Okun's Law states that a one percent increase in the difference between the actual and natural types of this concept will cause a 2 – 3% drop in GDP. The Keynesian, or cyclical, variety occurs when the economy does not exhibit sufficient aggregate demand for goods and services, while the frictional type describes people currently in this state who lack complete information about the labor market, such as recent graduates. Contrasted with inflation by the Phillips Curve and combined with it in the “misery index”, this is, for 10 points, what condition, exhibited by people on strike and victims of layoffs?<br>ANSWER: unemployment<br><br>13.
