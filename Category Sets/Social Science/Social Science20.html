The supply curve for this commodity will bend backwards and have a negative slope for high prices. The marginal revenue product for this determines its demand curve. A now outdated solution to the paradox of value is that the inherent value of an object depends only on the amount of this needed to produce it; that idea is credited to Karl Marx.
