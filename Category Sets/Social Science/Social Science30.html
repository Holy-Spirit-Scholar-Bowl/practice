1. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2003)<br>The “fateful hoaxing” of this work’s author was the subject of a book by Derek Freeman, who criticized the book for confusing the sexual jokes of natives with actual conduct and promoting an illegitimate theory of cultural determinism.

Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>In December 2010, Roger Wicker introduced legislation to "restore" this law. An argument based on this law was overruled by the Supreme Court in U.S. v. Darby Lumber Co., though the Court had attributed more power to it in Hammer v. Dagenhart. In United States v. Sprague, the Supreme Court ruled that this law "added nothing" to the Constitution.

Its namesake explained its results through the agentic state theory, though other explanations have included learned helplessness. The experimenter occasionally needed to say “you have no other choice, you must go on” despite the learner's heart condition. For 10 points, identify this Yale experiment which hired an actor to scream as participants administered higher and higher electrical shocks.<br>ANSWER: <u>Milgram</u> experiment<br><br>5. Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Bernhard Wiener developed a theory of this process to explain academic success and failure. Harold Kelley proposed the three factors of consistency, distinctiveness and consensus that affect this process in his covariation model, which explores how observers make causal inferences. An in-group negatively views the actions of an outgroup according to the </strong> "ultimate error" of this process. Lee Ross commented on a paper by Jones and Harris about biases in this process; that paper described subjects reading essays about Fidel Castro. People place too much importance on internal characteristics of actors, like personality traits, according to the "fundamental" error of this process.

Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2009)<br>Physics (10 Seconds)  This person worked independently from Ludwig Boltzmann on statistics to explain a kinetic theory of gases, but the results use both of their names. He also proposed that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon. This scientist’s best-known work, later revised by Oliver Heaviside, expressed as simply as possible the divergences and curls of electric and magnetic fields, tying together the work of Gauss, Faraday, and Ampere.

Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>He attempted to define his best-known theory in "Letter to a Japanese Friend," and that theory is the namesake of the Yale School, whose members included Paul de Man. He published a translation of Husserl's The Origin of Geometry, and he relied on graphic effects in his work The Post Card. He coined the term "differance" in his work Speech and Phenomena, and he argued that language cannot be the unambiguous carrier of </strong> truth.

Social Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>Hotelling's law used the example of ice cream stands on a beach to demonstrate that this situation can be advantageous to consumers, and total price discrimination can lead to this situation being Pareto optimal. A natural one involves decreasing marginal costs, often referred to as economies of scale, and this situation generally leads to deadweight loss and inefficiency because the marginal revenue curve lies below the demand curve. Such a firm has price-setting power and extracts positive profits because there are no close substitutes to its good. FTP, identify this economic situation in which a good is sold by only one firm.<br>ANSWER: monopoly<br><br>12. Social Science/All (NNT 2008)<br>One noted experiment by this man involved the forwarding of envelopes from person to person, tracking the amount of times the envelopes were sent.

Social Science/All (From Here To Eternity 2009)<br>Among the difficulties with this concept is that it is only defined by its inventor in essentially religious terms; it is hard for psychologists to identify.  Among those these is eupsychia, the culture that would be generated if 1,000 people with this condition lived on an island and built a utopia. Unlike the other concepts it is grouped with, it can never be fully satisfied. It stands at the apex of a group which includes physiological, safety, esteem, and cognitive needs.  For ten points, name this psychological concept, identified by Abraham Maslow at the top of his hierarchy of needs.<br>ANSWER: <u>Self</u>-<u>actualization</u> (or <u>self</u>-<u>transcendance</u>)<br><br>14.

In his most famous experiment, this man used a coin flip to divide his subjects into two different groups, and featured a solitary confinement cell. Half of the subjects in that experiment by this man began to exhibit sadistic tendencies, even though there had been no difference between the two groups at the outset of the study, and this man's experience with that experiment led him to testify in the aftermath of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal.

This book introduces the "MCM" and "CMC" paradigms for the flow of money into commodities, and it claims that the "use-value" of every good is objective and inherent.

The frustration-regression principle is addressed by Clayton Alderfer's extension of it, the E-R-G model.
