1. Social Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>This writer used Ingmar Bergman's film Wild Strawberries to analyze issues faced by elderly people. Many years ear- lier, this person wrote about the development through introspection achieved by both Sigmund Freud and Martin Lu- ther in his work Young Man Luther. A one-time patient of Anna Freud, he wrote that children can perceive what peo- ple really mean and that they reward love and take revenge on hatred in his book Childhood and Society. In his work In- sight and Responsibility, he wrote about the development of hope, will, purpose, competence, fidelity, love, care, and wisdom as the virtues people develop during their lives. Name this developmental psychologist who wrote about eight conflicts that people face at different stages of their lives.<br>ANSWER: Erik <u>Erikson</u><br><br>2. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2010)<br>The Markovian type of this concept is used to model inventory control. Two types which compensate for the income and substitution effects appear in the Slutsky equation; those are the Hicksian and Marshallian types. Its price elasticity is positive for Giffen and Veblen goods, which violate its namesake law. Its curve is typically downward-sloping, since consumers desire less of a product when price increases. Defined as the amount of a good or service consumers are willing to buy at a given price, for 10 points, name this quantity often paired with "supply."<br>ANSWER: demand<br><br>3. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Colonia 2 2011)<br>Relics found near Gibraltar provide evidence to this species' Mousterian culture. Recent evidence suggests this species may have cross-bred with homo sapiens. The first evidence of this species was discovered in 1829 at Engis, and this species is named for a German valley where several early specimens were discovered. This species had enlarged craniums and pronounced eyebrow ridges. For 10 points, name this close relation of modern humankind that disappeared 25,000 years ago.<br>ANSWER: <u>Neanderthals</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>This psychologist worked closely with programming language designer Seymour Papert, whose   namesake principle attempts to explain some of this person’s results. He argued for reflective  abstraction rather than pre-existing linguistic structures in a debate with Noam Chomsky. This   founder of the International Centre of Genetic Epistemology performed experiments demonstrating  that some people lack the understanding of conservation of number. One of his experiments involved  pouring water from a tall thin cup to a short fat cup, and he also studied the learning of object  permanence. Name this psychologist who included concrete operational and sensorimotor as two of  the four stages in his model of the cognitive development of children.<br>ANSWER: Jean Piaget [zhahn pee-a-zhay]<br><br>5. Social Science/None (BISB 2013)<br>These events occur because of PGO spikes and facilitate "reverse learning" according to a model of Crick and Mitchison. Hobson and McCarley stated that these events attempt to make sense of random activity in their formulation of the activation-synthesis theory. The symbolic meanings of these occurrences are called latent content and are covered up by the manifest content. One psychologist argued that these experiences satisfy the otherwise unacceptable feelings of the unconscious in his wish-fulfillment theory. For 10 points, name these events which are the subject of an "interpretation" in a book by Sigmund Freud and occur most vividly during REM sleep.<br>ANSWER: dreams<br><br>6. Social Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>A formula to regulate them and minimize their range was proposed at the Tokyo Round Negotiations and is known as the Swiss formula.  This is similar to a method meant to lower them, known as the Uruguay Round Approach. Deadweight loss often occurs in small nations when these are enacted, which typically come in ad valorem and specific types. The Morrill one was enacted in 1861 while one passed during Herbert Hoover's presidency led to “beggar thy neighbor” policies and would exacerbate the effects of the Great Depression. FTP, identify this government economic policy that includes ones named for Payne-Aldrich and Smoot-Hawley, that tax imported goods.  <br>ANSWER: <u>Tariff </u><br><br>7. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>This experiment was criticized in Chris Ferguson's paper "Blazing Angels or Resident Evil?" that claimed that the effect this study produced was short-lived and that it misinterpreted the motivations of its subjects. A 1992 paper co-written by Elizabeth Loftus questioned the ethics of this study that was organized by three people including Sheila and Dorothea Ross. Performed in the Stanford University </strong> nursery, its subjects were given a series of small hammers and interacted with an object painted like a clown while shouting "sockeroo!". For 10 points, identify this 1963 psychological experiment that involved children imitating adults' violent behavior against the namesake objects conducted by Albert Bandura.<br>ANSWER: the bobo doll study/experiment<br><br>8. Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>One article by this thinker denied the existence of true objective scientific analysis of culture. This man distingished between the charismatic, traditional, and legal "ideal types" of leadership in a book that claimed the state has a "monopoly on the legitimate use of force". This thinker outline the development of institutions that "dominate through knowledge" in Economy and Society. This author of Politics as a </strong> Vocation argued that individuals were increasing trapped in an "iron cage" of bureaucratic rationality in a work that traced how the rise of Reformation asceticism led to the flourishing of the free market. For 10 points, name this German sociologist who wrote The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.<br>ANSWER: Max <u>Weber</u> [or Karl Emil Maximilian <u>Weber</u>]<br><br>9.

This thinker described the female-dominated Tchambuli people, along with the Arapesh and Mundugumor in Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies. In one work, this woman wrote about the use of chicken blood to circumvent a system of ceremonial virginity, known as [*] taupou. That work was criticized by Derek Freeman, who claimed that the natives this woman interviewed lied about their adolescent experiences on the island of T’au in Polynesia. For 10 points, identify this female anthropologist, author of Coming of Age in Samoa.<br>ANSWER: Margaret <u>Mead</u><br><br>10. Social Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>This thinker wrote, “Treat social facts as things.” This writer asked what a social fact is in his plan to turn sociol- ogy into a science titled Rules of the Sociological Method. He explained how to return social norms in his work Moral Education and began using a term referring to unclear social norms in his first book The Division of Labour in Society. This writer's best known work classified a particular phenomenon four different ways based on levels of social integra- tion and moral regulation. Those four classifications are egoistic, altruistic, fatalistic, and anomic. Identify this French sociologist who wrote Suicide.<br>ANSWER: Emile <u>Durkheim</u><br><br>11. Social Science/All (From Here To Eternity 2009)<br>Robert Gordon's triangle model analyses three reasons why this phenomenon occurs. One variety of it arises when there is a there is a numerical difference between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. This concept and unemployment are linked in the Philips Curve.  Coming in cost-push and demand-pull varieties, monetarism believes it to be caused by increases in the money supply.  For ten points, name this economic whose hyper variety currently exists in Zimbabwe because they are drastically increasing the supply of money.<br>ANSWER: Inflation<br><br>12. Social Science/All (HAVOC II 2009)<br>One aspect of this concept concerns a type of evolutionary advance posited by John Maynard Smith which, once established, cannot be ousted by any alternative which begins in a weaker position. That aspect of it is related to a type of equilibrium in which both participants will not gain from a unilateral change in strategy. Another branch of this deals with situations in which one person gains at another's expense, the zero-sum. John Nash was one proponent of this field, which includes such problems as the Mexican Standoff, Stag Hunt, and Chicken. FTP, name this field of applied mathematics dealing with strategic behaviors, such as in the Prisoner's Dilemma.<br>ANSWER: <u>Game Theory</u><br><br>13. Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Charles Tilly compared state-making and this behavior to organized crime. James Fearon used a bargaining model to resolve the inefficiency puzzle of why it is pursued despite its cost. Kenneth Waltz examined this behavior through three "images of analysis." A book that sets forth a "fascinating trinity" of this behavior analogized confusion during it to a "fog." A 1973 resolution restricted the </strong> President's ability to engage in this behavior without a congressional declaration. Clausewitz declared this behavior an extension of policy by other means. Thomas Friedman claimed that this behavior has not occurred between two countries with McDonald's. The Geneva Conventions mandate humanitarian treatment during these events. For 10 points, name this kind of armed conflict among states.<br>ANSWER: <u>war</u> [or armed conflict until mentioned]<br><br>14. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regionals 2011)<br>These entities are modeled by the three-dimensional AIM model, which is an arm of the “activation-synthesis” theory that describes their cause as random activations of cells. Many evolutionary biologists theorize that they aid in problem solving. An older theory suggested that these entities contain manifest and latent content and use symbolic meaning as a means of censorship. For 10 points, name these phenomena which were analyzed in a Sigmund Freud book titled after their “interpretation.”<br>ANSWER: dreams<br><br>15. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 10 2009)<br><strong>This work states that the best type of intelligence can assess a situation for what it is, though the kind that can assess what others understand is good too. It contrasts the mutinous army of Scipio Africanus with the unified, though ethnically diverse, army of Hannibal. This book suggests that fortune, as a </strong> woman, should be held down. It dispenses such advice as to limit generosity and to never rely on mercenaries. It states that being feared is preferable to being loved. For 10 points, name this political treatise written by Machiavelli.<br>ANSWER: The <u>Prince</u> [or <u>Il Principe</u>]<br><br>16. Social Science/All (DAFT 2009)<br>This economist explored how medical licensing had raised the income of doctors relative to dentists in Incomes from Independent Professional Practice.

For 10 points, name this economist who formulated the permanent income hypothesis and wrote Capitalism and Freedom and A Monetary History of the United States.<br>ANSWER: Milton <u>Friedman</u><br><br>17. Social Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>This man was notable for outlining his vision of the ideal bureaucracy in his Economy and Society.  He also identified Legal, Traditional, and Charismatic as the three major types of political authority, and wrote works about the religions of India and China.

Social Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>This thinker defined religion as that which distinguishes between sacred and profane. This thinker also proposed that totemism was a force in the rise of religion and associated it with collective effervescence. This man claimed that capitalistic societies require more regulation to maintain stability than primitive ones. This man contrasted organic and mechanical solidarity in The [*] Division of Labor in Society and also wrote The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This man divided the title action into fatalistic, altruistic, egoistic and anomic varieties in another work.

This work also states that “the skill, dexterity, and judgment  with which. . . labour is generally applied” is more important than the rate of employment. This book   also stated that it would cost thirty times as much money to produce wine in Scotland as in France,  so Scotland should allow imported wines. This also uses the example of a pin factory to demonstrate  the importance of the division of labor.
