Fine Arts/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XV 2007)<br>|  The successful completion of its premiere performance was largely due to the efforts of the impresario, Sergei Diaghilev, and the choreographer, Vaslav Nijinsky. Camille Saint-Saens walked out on that 1913 premiere of this work of modern music. The composer claimed that his inspiration came from a fleeting vision of “sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death”. Some sources claim that it was the sexually suggestive dancing and not the harsh dissonance of the music that caused the famous riot. The revolutionary work depicts a pagan ritual performed for a specific season.
