Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>Its symmetry group is a ten-dimensional noncompact Lie [LEE] group called the Poincare group. The triangle inequality is reversed when operating on it, since if you consider it as a vector space, its inner product is not positive-definite. Instead, it has a signature with one unit vector of different sign from the others, meaning that any orthonormal basis of this space has one vector of different sign, and that vector is called the timelike component.
