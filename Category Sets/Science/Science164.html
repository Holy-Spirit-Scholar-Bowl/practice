The lengthening of polar microtubules and shortening of kinetochore microtubules help separate </strong> spindle poles during this phase. It is the shortest stage of mitosis, and it sees the migration of sister chromatids to opposite ends of the cell in preparation for the formation of daughter nuclei. For 10 points, this is what phase of mitosis that follows metaphase and precedes telophase?<br>ANSWER: anaphase<br><br>2. Science/All (WUHSAC IX 2007)<br>The term was first used by Prest Air Devices, which later trademarked the term and marketed it to railroad companies as a coolant. However, the term has lapsed from being trademarked and is now a generic word for the solid first described by Charles Thilorier, who opened a container of the liquid form, only to have most of it evaporate and some solidify. This is because carbon dioxide does not stay liquid at room temperature, going directly from gas to, for ten points, this solid state.<br>ANSWER: <u>dry ice</u> (do not accept, do not prompt “carbon dioxide”)<br><br>3. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Due to violations of special relativity, this concept fails around atomic number 173. In 1990, the IUPAC changed the numbering of groups to better reflect this concept, which explains the increased shielding of nuclear charge across a period. Madelung's (mah-DEH-loongz) rule determines order in this concept, while copper and chromium are no- table exceptions to it, since both lack full s orbitals in their electron configurations. Forcing three-d orbitals to be filled after four-s orbitals, name this principle whose name comes from the German for “building up”, and which requires electrons to enter atomic orbitals in a pattern that minimizes the total potential energy.<br>ANSWER: <u>Aufbau</u> principle [accept <u>building</u>-<u>up principle</u> before it is mentioned]<br><br>4. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>Lead and bismuth are separated in a process of this type named for Betts.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>Smart rubber uses them to reform itself when it is torn because they can reform instantaneously in that substance. In DNA, three of them occur between </strong> complementary base pair purines, and two between pyrimidines. They also account for the relatively high boiling point of water and the low density of ice. For 10 points, which type of bond is found between an electronegative atom such as oxygen or nitrogen and its namesake element?<br>ANSWER: <u>hydrogen</u> bonds<br><br>8. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>In the Diesel cycle, this value is held constant during cooling, which means that step is classified as isochoric. In an isobaric process, pressure is multiplied by the change in this quantity to calculate work. A common form of the Van der Waals equation subtracts n times b from this quantity, and, to calculate enthalpy, this quantity typically is multi- plied by pressure. According to both the Ideal Gas Law and Boyle's Law, this quantity varies inversely with pressure when temperature and number of moles is held constant. Name this quantity equal to mass divided by density that typically is measured in some form of cubic units.<br>ANSWER: volume<br><br>9. Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>They can be inactivated in a process called lyonization and form Barr bodies as a result. One mutation in it can cause over 200 repeats of the CGG sequence and results in a failure to express the FMR1 protein, leading to retardation. One disorder associated with this chromosome can cause webbed neck and horseshoe kidney, which was discovered by Ullrich and Turner. For 10 points, identify this sex chromosome that carries the gene for hemophilia and colorblindness.<br>ANSWER: <u>X</u> chromosome<br><br>10. Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>The dot product of x and y multiplies component-wise x and this of y.  When in polar form it is produced by negating the exponent.  For any real number taking it is the same as the identity function.  The addition of a number to this for that number produces a real number which is equal to double the real component of the previous number.   It is distributive over multiplication and addition and it is represented with a bar above the number, FTP, name this type of number formed by taking the negative of the imaginary part of a complex number.<br>ANSWER: <u>Complex Conjugate</u><br><br>11. Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>The "theria" hypothesis concerning this order's evolution was modified in 2005, holding that genetic drift was responsible for their acquisition of electroreceptive abilities. Fossil evidence indicates that this order's ancestors maintained tribosphenic molars and cynodonts in their mouths, but no known discovery explains their ability to maintain constant body temperature in a variety of environments. This order's most unorthodox aspect is their birthing process.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>These cause the only known diseases that can be sporadic, genetic, or infectious. They behave somewhat like ice-nine in Kurt Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle. Initially controversial because they violate the central dogma of molecular biology, the abnormal ones propagate themselves by causing the normal molecule to fold itself into the abnormally structured form, without the use of nucleic acids. They can cause Kuru, </strong> as well as scrapie in sheep and goats, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. They aggregate to form plaques called amyloids, which disrupt tissue structure and make brain tissue appear spongelike.

Science/Math (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>One method accomplishing this task marks two parallel lines above a ray, creating equal spaces, then folds the paper they are on so that a corner touches the middle line. Another method for this task uses a semicircle with two perpendicular segments called a tomahawk. Using classical tools, it can be approximated by infinitely alternating sides with a process that involves drawing three arcs. The function four x cubed minus three x equals a constant is used to determine whether the classical version of this task can be done. That equation was used by Pierre Wantzel to prove that this task, like </strong> doubling the cube, is impossible using only a straightedge-and-compass.
