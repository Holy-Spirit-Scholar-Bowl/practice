Science/Math (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2014)<br><strong>Raikov's theorem concerns the Poisson distribution of the sum between two of these types of random variables whose difference is plotted in a Skellam distribution. If the covariance is zero, then two events satisfy this property, which is shared by outcomes of Bernoulli trials. If one of two events occurs with probability </strong> zero, then those two events with this property can also be mutually exclusive. Events with this property have a joint probability equal to the product of their individual probabilities, examples of which include flipping coins and rolling dice.
