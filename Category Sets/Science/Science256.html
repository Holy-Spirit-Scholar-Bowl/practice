Science/Biology (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>One enzyme in this process known as acontinase is involved in a rehydration reaction after a dehydration one. Ubiquinone is degraded in one step by a protein using a FADH2 cofactor, and fumarate is formed in the only membrane-bound step of this process.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>Aliases used as examples in the write-up for it include Gretchen Brantt, Frerd Prozi, and Morris Braverman, who went into uncontrollable laughter. The results in that write-up were explained using agentic state theory and the work of Solomon Asch. During the experiment, a person at predetermined intervals would go from groaning to complaining until finally an "agonized scream" was released, after which no sounds were made.

Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XV 2007)<br>|  These organs are influenced by corticoptropin hormones secreted by the pituitary gland, which is in turn influenced by the hypothalamus to secrete those hormones. The hormones cause the creation of corticosteroids in the cortex of these organs. The cortex also produces androgen hormones as well as aldosterone.
