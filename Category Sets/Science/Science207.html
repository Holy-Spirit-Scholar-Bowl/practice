Six molecules of this hormone are coordinated to zinc in a vesicle. It leads to increased GLUT transporter activity in target tissues through tyrosine kinase activation. By activating PP2A, this molecule inhibits triglyceride breakdown, and in the liver it stimulates glycogen formation. One common disease sees peripheral tissues become </strong> resistant to this hormone, which is secreted from the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>TMEDA has a high affinity for this element’s ions. Its aluminum hydride can reduce esters into primary alcohols. The 2009 death of UCLA researcher Sheharbano Sangji was caused by this element’s flammable tert-butyl compound, which is a very strong base. Like strontium, it gives a crimson flame test, and it has the highest 2nd ionization energy of all the elements. Bombarding this element’s lightest isotope with neutrons produces tritium and helium, and its carbonate salt is used to treat bipolar disorder.

Science/All (HAVOC 2008)<br>The most common type of this reaction is the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, which is  often used as a synonym for the reaction as a whole. The products go on to form  Acetyl CoA or sometimes used in fermentation. Since two ATP molecules are  required to activate it, it produces only two net ATP molecules in addition to two  NADH molecules.

Science/All (BHSAT 2012)<br>In arthropods, this structure is composed of multiple ommatidia. Crystallins are responsible for the transparency of a part of this structure that is controlled by the ciliary muscles. In reptiles, it is covered by the nictitating membrane. The most basal organisms to possess a homologue of it are the euglenids, which use chromophores rather than rhodopsins. A scotopic process in this organ occurs mostly in cells outside the macula. In cephalopods, this organ is polarization-sensitive, and the nerve that receives sensation from it lies behind the rods and cones, eliminating the blind spot.
