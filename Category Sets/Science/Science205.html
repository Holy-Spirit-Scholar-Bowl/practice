Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>One paper postulates that this process explains the coronae of Venus, which are thought to arise from mantle plumes. This process typically results in the nearby development of back-arc basins, and it delaminates the lithosphere that enters the asthenosphere. Large igneous provinces, usually made of flood basalt, make one component of this process too buoyant, leading to the creation of fold mountains or volcanic island arcs.

This type of reaction is used with the Bessemer process to   remove impurities. Persulfate is a good agent of this type of reaction, as are the halogens due to  their high electronegativity; such agents, as opposed to the reactants, are electron acceptors.
