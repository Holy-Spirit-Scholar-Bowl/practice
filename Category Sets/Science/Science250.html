Their method of reproduction can employ either a basidia or an ascus, and some of these organisms employ rhizomorphs to imitate plant roots. A symbiotic relationship between a plant and one of these organisms is called mycorrhizae.

Science/All (Brookwood Invitational Scholars Bowl 2013)<br>Though not synchotrons, one type of these devices makes use of wigglers to accelerate electrons through a transverse magnetic field. In 2012, physicists used one of these devices to create particles which were successfully quantum teleported 150 kilometers away. These devices use optical pumping to bring the system to a short-lived state which decays into the most populated metastable state. That’s called population inversion.

Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>This phenomenon was documented by Paul Siple and Charles Passel during World War II. Since this value takes air circulation into account, convection caused by body heat has required modification of the original formula. When this value is low, there is a greater heat transfer from the body to the air. Re- ported as a number, it is generally less than the actual temperature because it does not account for humid- ity. This effect was originally calculated in terms of the time necessary for a container of water to freeze if left outdoors, and its formula takes into account wind speed and current temperature.
