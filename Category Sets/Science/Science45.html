Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>Abel’s identity uses a Wronskian to demonstrate a relationship between two solutions to this type of problem, and a more general form of Abel’s identity is Liouville’s formula. Those solutions work when the coefficients in this problem are all functions with respect to the independent variable, which is the homogeneous type of this. Examples with a single independent variable can sometimes be solved with Laplace (luh-PLAHS) transforms, while examples with more than one independent variable are “partial” as contrasted with “ordinary”.
