Science/All (OLEFIN 2011)<br><strong>This quantity increases as the shear rate increases in dilatant materials. In thixotropic materials, this quantity decreases over time when shear stress is constant. The dynamic form of this quantity, written mu or eta, is defined by the equation shear stress equals mu times the velocity gradient. When helium-4 is cooled below the lambda point it acquires a value of zero for this quantity, which is equal to zero for all superfluids. It is constant for a </strong> Newtonian fluid and the ratio of inertial forces to those related to this property is called the Reynolds number.

Science/All (HSAPQ NASAT Tryout Set 2009)<br>Python employs the "duck" way of determining these constructs. C++ can use RTTI to determine these at runtime as a form of introspection, and C++ uses templates in a similar fashion to "generic" ones. Programming languages can be classified by having static, dynamic, strong, or weak systems of these. If built into a language they can be called "primitive," while object-oriented programming allows the programmer to implement new ones.

Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>This rule was born out of the Abegg's rule, which concerns the difference between the maximum and minimum valences that an element can take. The 3-center-4-electron model explains the violation of this rule by hypervalent molecules. This rule is also violated in molecules such as boron trifluoride and free radicals such as nitric oxide, both of which react to obey this rule.

Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>The coelomic (SEE-loh-mihk) sac, found in the coxal glands of crustaceans, is analogous to this microscopic structure in mammals. It has both vascular and urinary poles, and Bright's disease causes this structure to become blocked with crystals and epithelial cells. Ultrafiltering podocytes in this structure can collect solutes smaller than eight nanometers, explaining the high concentration of salt and sugar in its lumen.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>This phenomenon is not possible in planar, finite, continuous dynamics due to the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem. Given mixing and density properties, it corresponds to a Lyapunov exponent with positive real part because it is typified by exponential divergence in time of initially close trajectories. The long-time behavior of all trajectories in systems exhibiting this behavior is typified by fractals to which all points in state space converge, termed strange attractors.
