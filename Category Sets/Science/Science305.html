Science/All (QuAC I 2008)<br>The decay of beryllium-14 suggests that this particle may exist in free clusters of four. This particle's charge can be altered by the emission of a W boson, antineutrino and a lepton, and one of these particles can be formed through electron capture.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>The type of these highest in the atmosphere appears to be increasing in frequency, brightness, and extent, which is believed to be linked to climate change. Those are the noctilucent variety. The nacreous variety has been implicated in the creation of ozone holes due to their disruption of the nitrogen and chlorine cycles. Adiabatic cooling is one of the main agents of the formation of these. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck’s system of categorizing these was unpopular because it employed unusual French names.

One technique for estimating this extrinsic quantity is mark-and-recapture. Genetic drift occurs because this quantity is always finite. As may have happened to humankind after the Toba event, bottleneck events occur when it suddenly decreases.

That data structure is the Bloom filter. Highly specific tests minimize the occurrence of these events. Epidemiological tests for non-life-threatening conditions that are costly to treat generally seek to minimize their occurrence.

Science/All (HSAPQ NASAT Tryout Set 2009)<br>This law's integral and differential forms can be related by the Kelvin-Stokes Theorem. The original formulation of this law broke the rule that the divergence of a curl must be zero; that flaw was corrected with the addition of a displacement current by James Maxwell.
