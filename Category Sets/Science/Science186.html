It can be found in eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts, but its primary location is in the cytoplasm. Its A, P, and E sites bind to aminoacyl, peptidyl, and free tRNAs, respectively, and it is composed of one large and one small subunit, which disassociate after each use.

Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>They can be generated using a basic Platonic sequence and the Greeks had a formula for generating them which required two relatively prime numbers of opposite parity. They can be generated using Euclid's formula and the largest numbers in each set are odd and have prime factors of the form 4n+1. These groups of numbers are referred to as primitive if they are coprime, although they can all be multiplied by a common factor.  Fermat's Last Theorem can be seen as an attempt to find these kinds of numbers to a higher power and adding a fourth number generates a namesake quadruple, of which one example is 2,3,6,7.
