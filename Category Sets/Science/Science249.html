1. Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XV 2007)<br>|  This plant tissue is formed in woody plants by the vascular cambium, but in non-woody plants, it forms from the procambium. In woody plants, lignin is deposited in the cell walls of these tissues, forming wood. In angiosperms, it is generally composed of several types of cells, including tracheids, which are usually dead. Gymnosperms typically possess only tracheids. The cohesion of water molecules as they evaporate from the leaves is responsible for drawing water and minerals up through it from the roots. FTP, name this plant tissue, found in bundles with its counterpart, phloem, as veins in leaves.          |<br>ANSWER: <u>Xylem</u><br><br>2.

The inverses of integrals developed to find the arc length of this shape create curves that were mapped to modular forms in the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. The parametric equations for this shape, with a and b not necessarily equal, are x equals a cosine of t and y equals b sine of t. This shape is commonly drawn by using a piece of </strong> string fixed to two pins. This shape has a semimajor and a semiminor axis, as well as an eccentricity between zero and one.

Science/All (HSAPQ Colonia 2 2011)<br>These animals do not produce very concentrated urine because their kidneys lack loops of Henle and instead rely on the colon to reabsorb water. A suborder in this class of animals uses infrared sensitivity to detect prey; those animals are in the Squamata group that includes the Gila monster.
