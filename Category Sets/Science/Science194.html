1. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>Carathéodory introduced the concept of “adiabatic accessibility” to approach this statement, holding that an initial adiabatically isolated state would not be able to approach other states in its neighborhood. This postulate appears to contradict T-symmetry in Loschmidt’s paradox, and heat from a reservoir cannot perfectly be converted into work in the Kelvin-Planck formulation of this statement. This postulate states that heat cannot flow from a colder body to a warmer body without doing work, according to Clausius’s formulation. Apparently violated by Maxwell’s Demon, for 10 points, name this law which states that the entropy of a closed system always increases.<br>ANSWER: <u>Second</u> Law of Thermodynamics<br><br>2. Science/Biology (NTSS 2013)<br>Some animals in this phylum have small skeletal-like projections called pedicellaria. Animals in this phylum that can be fossilized to form St. Cuthbert's beads are called crinoids. Scientists sometimes only classify animals in this phylum if they contain stereom skeletons. The feet of animals in this phylum, which contain ampulla and podia, are called tube feet. One of its subphyla is asterozoa, many of which have a five-point radial symmetry, while examples of these without such symmetry include sea urchins and sea cucumbers.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>One set of mathematical constructs named for this man are Hermitian and unitary, and thus correspond to the observables of the complex Hilbert space with two dimensions. This man used the conservation of energy and momentum in beta decay to theorize the existence of the neutrino. He names a set of three matrices that describe spin, and one of his results explains why neutron stars below the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit don’t collapse.  That principle concerns the anti-symmetric quantum states of fermions, explaining why electrons with the same spin cannot occupy the same orbital. For 10 points, name this Austrian theoretical physicist with a namesake Exclusion Principle.<br>ANSWER: Wolfgang Pauli<br><br>4. Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>This quantity is the first one examined when using the Hammond postulate.  The negative of this quantity divided by the gas constant is the slope of the line formed in a plot named for the same man who names the equation that calculates this quantity.  That expression is the negative product of the gas constant, temperature, and the natural log of the reaction rate over the pre-exponential factor, and is named for Arrhenius. Catalysts increase the reaction rate by lowering this quantity.

Science/All (Ohio State/VCU housewrite 2012)<br><strong>This disease is treated with Rifampicin and Isoniazid.  BCG is commonly used as a vaccine for this disease, although its efficacy has been debated. The miliary form of this disease can spread to other organs like the liver and spleen. Approximately one third of the world’s population is thought to be infected with this disease. A Totally-Drug-Resistant strain of the causative agent of this disease was recently isolated in India.

Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>Millman's Theorem can be applied to these, as can the delta-wye transform or the program SPICE. Hans Mayer and Edwin Norton independently arrived at a theorem that can also simplify their analysis, now known as Norton's Theorem. That theorem is a companion to Thévenin's [THEV ninz] Theorem, which simplifies linear ones into just two components and was discovered by Hermann von Helmholtz. Another law applied to these can be stated as the divergence of the J-field equals negative the divergence of the partial derivative of the displacement field with respect to time, but is more often written in relation to sums at a node. That is, along with the loop rule, one of Kirchhoff's [KERK awvs] laws for these. Iden- tify these connections of components such as inductors, capacitors, and resistors that can also sometimes be analyzed with Ohm's Law.<br>ANSWER: electrical <u>circuits</u> or <u>electrical networks</u><br><br>7.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>The use of this entity's namesake coordinates reduces a two-body problem to two one-body problems because all motion can be decomposed into rotation about and translation of this entity; consequently, the so-called effective force and moment on a body act at this location.
