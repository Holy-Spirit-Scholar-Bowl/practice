1. Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XV 2007)<br>|  It can be calculated by taking the integral of torque with respect to the angular positions before and after.  An alternative definition says that at constant volume and pressure, it is simply the product of pressure and the change in volume.  If volume is constant, then it is zero.  It is energy transferred to or from a system by means of an external force, and when friction is not involved, it is equal to the change in mechanical energy.

Science/Physics (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>In a fluid at rest, this principle requires that the components on the diagonal of the stress tensor be equal. This principle is often proven geometrically for a static fluid at rest by considering a triangular prism, or wedge. Due to this principle, the ratio of two forces must equal the ratio of the area over which they are applied in a hydraulic pump. It was apocryphally demonstrated by pouring water into a ten meter high tube attached to a barrel already filled with water, causing the barrel to promptly </strong> explode. This principle is often stated mathematically as fluid density times acceleration due to gravity times difference in height equals difference in pressure.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>Its conclusions have been used to propose a novel method of detecting wire taps, in which a tapped message will be detectable because it will be different at each end of the transmission. Its creator intended to criticize the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, and it may have contributed to the development of the competing many-worlds theory. The setup involved an amount of radioactive material so small that, with equal probability, either one or zero atoms of it would decay within one hour. If an atom did decay, it would set off a Geiger counter that would destroy a bottle containing poison.

Rather than a sharp boundary at the edge of the sample, there is a gradual decay of the magnetic field across the penetration depth of the material. This is caused by persistent </strong> currents which form on the surface of the material as it is cooled below the critical temperature, which completely cancel out the flux inside it, resulting in perfect diamagnetism.
