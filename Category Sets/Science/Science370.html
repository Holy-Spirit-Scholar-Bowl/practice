1. Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>S  SCIENCE  Its isotherms obey an equal-area rule named for Maxwell, and like the Tait equation, a modified form of it is often used as a PVT equation for compressible fluids. One of its principle failings comes at gas-liquid equilibria, since it does not predict that at constant temperature, pressure is constant as volume varies; however, a law that improves on it further, the Redlich-Kwong equation, does even worse with vapor-liquid equilibria. Its two parameters account for particle size and nonzero interparticle interaction strength and are typically written as a and b. It shares a namesake with the forces arising from particles developing instantaneous dipoles, also known as London dispersion forces. For 10 points, identify this equation of state, an improvement on and generalization of the ideal gas law.<br>ANSWER: <u>van der Waals</u> equation<br><br>2. Science/All (MSU/UD Housewrite 2012)<br><strong>At constant temperature and volume, the useful amount of this quantity equals the Helmholtz free energy. Closed paths in conservative vector fields have a net value of</strong> zero for this quantity. In a thermodynamic system, the change in this quantity is equal to the integral of pressure through the change in volume. This quantity is equal to the line integral along the path of the force dotted with dx [dee x]. For 10 points, name this quantity that is equal to the product of the force and the distance it acts over.<br>ANSWER: <u>work</u><br><br>3. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 15 2011)<br><strong>The LINEAR one of these objects showed evidence of spontaneous splitting. They have been shown to have CHON particles. The Kreutz Group of them are </strong> sungrazers. These objects are often described using the Whipple model. Long period ones are believed to originate in the Oort Cloud. Their main body is called the nucleus, while the gases and dust make up the coma and tail. For 10 points, name these small icy bodies that have a highly elliptical orbit around the sun, famous examples of which include Hale-Bopp and one named for Halley.<br>ANSWER: comets<br><br>4. Science/Other (JAMES 2015)<br><strong>Bulb-like lobes are evident in this entity's Malaspina example, which is one of the Piedmont types of this body. The absence of these bodies leads to isostatic rebound after initial crust subsidence. Holes known as moulins may occur in these bodies, and elongated hills called </strong> drumlins can be formed by these bodies. Ablation zones are regions where these bodies lose mass, and the tracks of debris they leave behind are called moraines. The majority of the world's fresh water is contained in these bodies, examples of which include ice sheets. Icebergs break off of, for 10 points, what large moving masses of ice?<br>ANSWER: glaciers (prompt on "ice sheet" before it is read)<br><br>5. Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>Applicable when the spread equals one, this statement can be formulated in terms of addition using rational trigonometry. A generalization of it to inner product spaces is known as Parseval's identity, while a three-dimensional generalization is de Gua's theorem. The parallelogram law simplifies to this statement in a special case, and one proof of this theorem constructs congruent triangles whose areas are half those of a square and a rectangle. It is generalized by the law of cosines to triangles with any three angles. For 10 points, name this theorem used to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, stated as A squared plus B squared equals C squared.<br>ANSWER: <u>Pythagorean</u> theorem<br><br>6. Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>The streptomyces bacterium produces an antibiotic that can be deactivated by this process; that molecule, tetracycline, cannot be taken with milk or indigestion remedies containing zinc. In organic chemistry, stereoselectivity can be induced by the use of this process, particularly in the presence of esters and amides, a technique called this control. Virtually all biological molecules can do this, but some have specificity for a certain ion, like the porphyrin rings in hemoglobin, which do this to iron. FTP, name this term for the binding of several ligands to one metal ion.<br>ANSWER: <u>chelation</u> (or <u>chelates</u>; accept <u>chelation</u>-<u>control</u> after “<u>stereoselectivity</u>”)<br><br>7. Science/Chemistry (Masonic 2014)<br>When this value is calculated for different elements, hydrogen is given a value above two so that all elements have positive values. This was calculated by taking the square root of the difference of a dissociation energy and the average of two other dissociation energies. This value depends largely on the number of spaces in the outer energy level and its distance from the nucleus. Name this value invented by Linus Pauling measuring the ability of an atom to attract electrons, a value high in fluorine.<br>ANSWER: electronegativity (accept word forms)<br><br>8. Science/Biology (BELLOCO 2014)<br>This quantity appears in the denominator of a differential equation formulated by Verhulst. In the logistic growth model, this quantity is graphically represented by a horizontal asymptote. A population of r-strategists can overshoot this quantity because growth is not dependent on a stable equilibrium phase, but a population of k-strategists tends to grow towards this quantity gradually. The rate of growth of a population is zero when this quantity is reached, at which the birth and death rates are equal. For 10 points, name this biological quantity determined by limiting factors, the maximum population size of a given species that an environment can sustain indefinitely<br>ANSWER: carrying capacity [prompt on "K"]<br><br>9. Science/Other (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Chris Newhall proposed a qualitative scale that assigns a value between "0" and "8" inclusive for these occurrences. The largest of these events on that scale in the past tens of thousands of years is the "Oruanui" (OR-oo-uh-new-ee) one. Stephen Ambrose suggested that one of these events in Toba is linked with a genetic bottleneck. When one of these events occurs underneath a glacier, a dangerous flood called a jokulhlaup (YOH-kull-ayupp) may occur. The </strong> "phreatic" type of these events can create formations called maars. Pliny the Elder gives his name to a type of these events, which can eject namesake "bombs." Lapilli and other tephra may be ejected during these events, which can create deadly pyroclastic flows.

Science/All (OLEFIN 2011)<br><strong>One algorithm that does this in square root of N time uses a quantum computer and is named for Grover. Finding shortest routes on a graph often involves the A star method for doing this. One algorithm for it runs in log N time by splitting the data in half at each step; that is the </strong> binary algorithm for doing this. Switching between using a stack and a queue will switch between depth-first and breadth-first methods for doing this, while the simplest way to perform this action on a list is to iterate through the list, comparing each element encountered to the desired element.

Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>A counterpart to it involves reluctance and is known as Hopkinson's Law. It can be applied to hydraulics in describing the relationship between pressure and flow rate. The continuum form of this law can be combined with the integral of the electric field and the cross-section area to get another form. Another version of this law expresses two of the values in root mean square form and switches another of the terms for impedance. Modified versions of this law include one that has a term for self-inductance and another that can be used to calculate the electromotive force. FTP, name this law that states that voltage is equal to the product of current and resistance.<br>ANSWER: <u>Ohm's</u> Law<br><br>12. Science/All (SCOP 3 2012)<br><strong>The nucleus of an immature one of these cells is called a germinal vesicle, and one of   these structures is released during the luteinizing hormone surge. They mature  through oogenesis, and these cells contribute all organelles to the </strong> zygote.

Science/All (WUHSAC IX 2007)<br>They are created by the homolytic cleavage of a bond, a process that is common in peroxides. Involved in combustion, they also play a significant role in polymerization reactions and must be eliminated in termination steps. Examples include ethynyl, C2H, and molecular cyanide.

Science/All (HSAPQ Colonia 2 2011)<br>A powdered form of this element is extracted via the Wöhler process. This element’s oxide is usually extracted from bauxite via the Bayer process, and occurs naturally as corundum. Industrially, the Hall-Héroult process produces this most abundant metal in the Earth’s crust.

Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>Peter Goldreich applied earlier Lin-Shu density wave theory to these entities, which exhibit high Tholin concentration in regions named for Methone and Anthe. Rotating magnetosphere oscillations known as spokes were cited in these entities by Voyager, suggesting that a purely gravity-based explanation for their formation is unlikely. The Horshoe orbits of Janus and Epimetheus create the Encke region in these objects, which also contain the Keeler Gap. The Pallene region is separated from the outermost “E” region in these entities by Mimas. For Ten Points, identify these objects created by shepherd moons like Titan and home to the Cassini division, which surround the sixth planet from the sun.<br>ANSWER: <u>Rings</u> of <u>Saturn</u> (accept equivalents)<br><br>17. Science/All (PACE NSC 2001)<br>Symptoms of this disease, to which donkeys are among the only mammals with immunity, usually start with paralysis of eyelid muscles, and are caused by blockage of acetylcholine release at synapses; death, which can occur in over 25% of cases, comes from paralysis of muscles of respiration. _FOR 10 POINTS_—name this disease, named for the Latin for “sausage,” caused by the most potent toxin known.<br>ANSWER: <u>Botulism</u> or Clostridium <u>botulinum</u> poisoning [prompt on “food poisoning”]<br><br>18. Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>Feynman and Gell-Mann proposed a V minus A Lagrangian for it to account for one of the ramifications of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix. Its short range of influence, smaller than an atomic nucleus, is caused by its massive gauge bosons. Some interactions of it can result in a change of flavor, and they violate parity symmetry because it affects only left-handed particles. In addition, it is the only fundamental force that affects neutrinos. FTP, identify this force responsible for beta decay, which is carried by the W-plus, W-minus, and Z-zero bosons.<br>ANSWER: <u>weak</u> (nuclear) force (accept <u>weak</u> interactions)<br><br>19. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>This figure is formed by graphing y=(1/x) with a domain restriction to avoid the asymptote, then rotating it in 3 dimensions around the x axis. Integrating under the curve shows that the volume approaches pi, while the surface area is greater than two pi times the natural log of the upper bound of integration. This is sometimes called the painter's paradox </strong> as painting an infinite area requires an infinite amount of paint, but filling the figure requires a finite volume of paint. FTP, name this figure with infinite surface area, but finite volume.<br>ANSWER: <u>Gabriel's horn</u> or <u>Torricelli's trumpet</u> (accept “<u>painter's paradox</u>” early)<br><br>20.

In dicots, anisocytic ones are surrounded by three subsidiary cells and they are produced from a sequence of two unequal cell divisions. They move in response to a loss of chloride and potassium after the release of abscisic acid triggered by the roots. Their most famous role involves a mechanism that uses PEP carboxylase, prevents photorespiration, and minimizes water loss, in which they open only at night in CAM plants.
