The first corals appeared during this period, as well as the eozostrodon, one of the first true mammals. The seed ferns known as Glossopteris went extinct at the end of it. The extinction that preceded this period destroyed a multitude of insects, and this period is marked by no coal deposits, which is known as its coal gap. This period followed the so-called </strong> "Great Dying", which occurred at the end of the Permian period.
