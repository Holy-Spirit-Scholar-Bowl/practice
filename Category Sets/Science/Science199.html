Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>The protein presenilin, mutant versions of which cause Alzheimer disease, is located primarily in it, and filamentous material is associated with the center of each of its units. Complex glycosylation of molecules occurs within it by means of sugar transferases that face its lumen, and it actually breaks up and disappears at the onset of mitosis. Generally divided into cis, medial, and trans faces, the last of which releases clathrin-coated vesicles, it consists of a stack of five to eight flattened cisternae.

Science/All (JAMES 2013)<br><strong>In X-bar theory, this class of words, along with determiners and quantifiers, fills the determining phrase in a specifier slot. The negative variety of these words was argued by Noam Chomsky to be neither definite or indefinite. The closest to this word's partitive variety in English is the word </strong> "some." These words were likely not present in Proto-Indo-European, explaining their lack of presence in Latin and Russian. These special adjectives define the type of reference to a noun in English.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>In one use of this technique, highly deuterated solvents such as deuterated chloroform are needed to ensure that the solvent does not interfere with the reading. In another use of this technique, the relative rarity of the Carbon-13 isotope means that samples usually need to be enriched and the DEPT can be measured to determine how substituted a carbon is. The spectra produced show the chemical shifts of the molecules in the compound that are a result of the molecules achieving resonant absorption.

Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>With Pierre Duhem, this man names an equation describing the change in chemical potential. He also stated that the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the number of components minus the number of phases plus two. The change in one quantity named for this man defines reactions as endergonic or exergonic. That quantity, whose change is less than zero for a spontaneous reaction , is equal to the enthalpy minus the entropy times the temperature.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>This man discovered that a geometric increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels leads to an arithmetic increase in temperature. The Eyring equation is equivalent to his namesake equation, which includes a constant equal to the steric factor times the collision rate, called the pre-exponential factor. That equation states that “k equals A times e to the negative E sub a over RT,” which relates the rate of a reaction to its activation energy.

The largest known skeleton of this dinosaur is found at the Field Museum in Chicago and is named Sue. Jack Horner argues that this therapod was unable to run because of its heavy head, and that it must have therefore been a scavenger. Much speculation about this dinosaur focuses on its tiny arms.

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>These can be analyzed by the Burgi-Dunitz approach and are the reason for the unique negative slope of the solid-  liquid line on water‟s phase diagram. Dihydrogen oxide has two lone pairs and two free protons per molecule so it  can form two of these, while ammonia can only form one because although it has three protons it only has a single  lone pair. These are re-formed by RAD51 and 52 in a process called annealing, and three of these are formed  between cytosine and guanine and two between adenine and thymine. These consist of a proton stuck in a pickle  between two highly-electronegative atoms, namely nitrogen, fluorine, or oxygen.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>Divisions of this time period include the Cisuralian, Guadalupian, and Lopingian epochs. The continent of Cimmeria separated from Gondwana during this period, which resulted in the shrinking of the Paleo-Tethys sea and the formation of the Tethys sea to its south. Modern trees like conifers and ginkos first appeared in this period, whose dry conditions favored the growth of gymnosperms. This period was dominated by synapsids such as pelycosaurs, dinocephalia, and gorgonopsians. Preceded by the Carboniferous Period, it was first introduced in 1841 by Roderick Murchison.
