Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>The results of this experiment were disputed by Felix Ehrenhaft, who claimed to have gotten values that were a fraction of the minimum possible value. Since the scale of this experiment was on a very small level, Stokes' Law was invalid, which meant that the pressure had to be adjusted in order to find he effect of the viscosity of air. However, an error resulted in the final value to be off by about one percent. It used two </strong> charged parallel metal plates, creating a potential difference, which was then adjusted such that the electric force perfectly counteracted the force of gravity on the titular substance.

In addition to being calculated by the Sackur-Tetrode equation, this quantity is equal to the negative partial derivative of Gibbs free energy with respect to temperature.

Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>It had two main types, ad-hoc and parametric, and in C++ [see plus plus], this language fea- ture is implemented with template classes or functions. Associated with strongly-typed languages, a more subtle form of this is the use of one symbol to perform several similar operations, such as concatenation and addition, a technique called operator overloading.
