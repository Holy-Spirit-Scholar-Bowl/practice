Emlen and Oring hypothesized that one system of this behavior occurred most frequently at highly clumped resources and total asynchronous temporal availability. The hotshot and hotspot hypotheses explain why individuals congregate at leks in the leadup to this </strong> behavior. RA Fisher proposed "runaway selection" of traits that led to this behavior.

Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>A 2010 book by Richard Wrangham argues that a certain behavioral innovation led to the rise of this species, citing its considerably smaller and simpler digestive tract. This species made extensive use of the Acheulean artifacts and may have experienced a case of island dwarfism leading to the evolution of Homo floresiensis, or "Hobbit man." Richard Leakey's 1984 discovery of </strong> "Turkana Boy" ignited an extended debate over this species' connection with Homo ergaster. Eugene Dubois discovered its first known specimen in 1891.
