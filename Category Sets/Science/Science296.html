In organic chemistry, these compounds activate electrophiles like carbonyls or alkyl halides. KHP serves this role in reactions. These compounds dehydrate sugars to pure carbon. The inductive effect explains why nearby electronegative groups increase the </strong> strength of these compounds. The "mineral" type of these compounds are inorganic. Ammonium chloride and ferric chloride act as these species. The strength of these compounds varies inversely with their pKas. In reactions, they are often written as "HA."

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>This man concluded that adding dehydrated salts to a solution does not increase the volume of solution in a paper grouped with "On Microcosmic Salt." He concluded that when pressure and temperature are held constant, the heat of a fluid is proportional to its weight, in a section of A New System of Chemical Philosophy. The unit of </strong> atomic mass is named for this man, who concluded that all elements are made of atoms and that atoms combine to form chemical compounds. For 10 points, name this chemist with a namesake law of partial pressures.<br>ANSWER: John Dalton<br><br>3. Science/All (BHSAT 2009)<br>Solutions that do not follow it over a wide range of concentrations cannot be classified as perfect. Those that obey it can be classified as ideal, while others deviate from it based on their activity coefficient relative to one. While a mixture of trichloromethane and ethoxyethane results in a negative deviation, a mixture of water and ethanol positively deviate,  though both are examples of azeotropes. FTP, name this law, which states that the component vapor pressure of a  substance is equivalent to its mole fraction times its vapor pressure in pure form.<br>ANSWER: Raoult’s Law<br><br>4. Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>An instance of this effect is credited by some historians as setting off the famines that energized the French Revolution, while another is tied to the demise of the Moche civilization. Both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans see a lower incidence of tropical cyclones during an instance of this, and 1998 contained an especially intense instance of this phenomenon, helping lead to that year being the warmest on record. Its atmospheric component is defined by the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia, and is measured by the Southern Oscillation Index.

Science/Other (BELLOCO 2014)<br>The remnants of these phenomena may undergo the Sedov-Taylor phase before experiencing the snowplow phase. Wolf-Rayet stars are the progenitors to one type of these phenomena, and the presence of hydrogen absorption lines in their spectra leads to their Type II designation. The Type Ia ("one-A") of these phenomena is created after the mass of a white dwarf in a binary system exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit. The Crab Nebula is a remnant of one of these phenomena that occurred in 1054. These phenomena often occur when a lack of electron degeneracy pressure causes core collapse to a neutron star. For 10 points, name these luminous stellar explosions.<br>ANSWER: supernovas [or supernovae; or SNe]<br><br>6. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>A possible cause for the occurrence of the deep-focus ones of these is the phase transition of olivine into a spinel structure. Wadati-Benioff zones are inclined areas in subduction zones in which these occur, and the absolute magnitude of one of these is assessed by the moment magnitude scale. The Gutenberg-Richter law provides a probability distribution for the occurrence of these with respect to magnitude. The apparent magnitude of these phenomena is currently measured using the modified Mercalli scale, but was previously reported by the Richter scale.

Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament (FKT) 2012)<br>The abundance of elements heavier than iron is largely due to nucleosynthesis during these events. These events are classified based on their emission spectra and light curves. The Type I kind occurs when a white dwarf exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit, while Type II kinds of these occur when a massive star starts to collapse.  A famous one happened in 1054 C.E. and resulted in the formation of the Crab nebula.  Neutron stars and black holes often result from these events.

Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2006)<br>Chemical reactions of this type can be used to power an electric cell since, by definition, they are able to generate a current. When balancing these types of reactions, one typically splits a reaction into two half- reactions and conserves the number of electrons. Most biochemical reactions are this type of reaction.  Metals rusting and potatoes browning are both everyday examples of this class of reactions.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>Quantum-mechanical waves can be seen with the naked eye due to the constancy of their phases. One theory, named after London, treats certain isotopes as ideal ones, and one of them was made from sodium-23 by Wolfgang Ketterle. However, the first was created by Cornell and Wieman at JILA in Colorado, who supercooled two thousand rubidium atoms and caused them to act as a single “superatom.” For 10 points, name these collections of particles cooled below a critical temperature, a so-called fifth state of matter, predicted by an Indian and a German physicist for whom they are named.<br>ANSWER: <u>Bose-Einstein</u> condensates<br><br>10.
