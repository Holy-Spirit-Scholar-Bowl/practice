Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>This process is observed almost entirely in precocial species, though it has been observed in k-selected fish like the convict cichlid [SIK-lihd]. The influence of this process on mate selection is evident in zebra finches, whose females prefer males with head ornamentation resembling their fathers’. The failure of sandhill cranes to serve as effective surrogates to whooping cranes is explained by this process, whose key stimulus was found to be movement for the graylag geese studied by Konrad Lorenz. Zookeepers take advantage of this learning mechanism to hand-rear baby mammals, while ultralight aircraft pilots have used it to teach endangered birds to migrate. Explaining why chicks constantly follow a hen and occurring only during a brief, critical period, named this form of learning in which young animals develop a long-lasting attachment to a nearby object or individual, thereafter recognized as their “mother”.<br>ANSWER: filial <u>imprinting</u> [accept word forms]<br><br>3.

One process that creates these rocks is restricted to an aureole and is the contact type. One property of these rocks can be a result of alternating felsic and mafic layers, forming light and dark bands.
