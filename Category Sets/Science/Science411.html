Müller received the 1946 Nobel Prize for inducing this phenomenon in fruit flies, and Pearson syndrome is a pancreas disease resulting from this process in the mitochondria. The CCR5 delta-32 type of it gives humans resistance to HIV, while the pyrimidine dimer form linked to melanoma is caused by UV rays. Proofreading by polymerase does not always prevent the severe frameshift type of it, and point examples include silent, missense, and nonsense. These events provide the genetic variety needed for evolution but are also responsible for diseases like cystic fibrosis and hemophilia.

Science/All (HSAPQ Colonia 2 2011)<br>This principle explains why the use of greater camber allows for the operation of certain objects. This theorem explains the changes that happen to certain molecules inside a Venturi tube.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>This compound is industrially used to synthesize R22, a major intermediate in Teflon production. This compound must be kept in dark bottles or amber because it forms phosgene in the presence of oxygen and UV light. Nucleic acid extraction is commonly performed via mixtures of phenol and this.

Precursors to this tissue are generated at the epiphyseal (EPP-ih-FIZZ-ee-uhl) plate. Since estrogen causes cells that resorb this tissue to undergo apoptosis, this tissue becomes noticeably weaker in post-menopausal (men-oh-"PAWS"-uhl) women.

Science/Other (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>A since-discredited hypothesis of Archie Carr used this theory to explain the migration of the green sea turtle from Brazil to Ascension Island. The concentration of the Megascolecidae family of earthworms was used to support this theory. The major animal fossils that were analyzed to support this theory belonged to Mesosaurus, Cynognathus, and Lystrosaurus. An early supporter of this theory, Alexander du Toit, presented evidence for it based on the </strong> distribution of tillite overlaid by coal beds overlaid by basaltic flows. Those coal beds often contained Glossopteris fossils, which had extremely large seeds - preventing their dispersal by sea or air. This theory was built on to develop plate tectonics. For 10 points, identify this theory proposed by Alfred Wegener in which the Earth's continents move relative to each other.<br>ANSWER: continental drift [or plate tectonics until it is read; or obvious equivalents, such as the fact that continents move until \"continents move relative to each other\" is read]<br><br>17.
