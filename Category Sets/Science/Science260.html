Science/Other (Masonic 2014)<br>These objects leave chatter marks when they pluck. These grow at accumulation zones, and they shrink at ablation zones, with sudden shrinkage caused by calving. The debris left behind by these objects accumulates to form moraines. These can leave behind depressions called cirques [sirks], which are sometimes filled with tarn lakes.

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>In solid compounds, this class of reactions occurs in three distinct phases in which preheating leads to a second distillation stage. At the molecular level, these types of reactions can only be initiated if a heat- induced spin-paired state is achieved, which subsequently reacts to produce the heat that propagates the reaction. Certain types require consideration of the air to fuel ratio, while liquid fuels used in these have to above the flash point temperature.
