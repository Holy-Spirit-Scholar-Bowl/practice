1. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>This relation is held by two matrices A and B if there exists a matrix P such that A equals P times B times P inverse, meaning that the matrices represent the same transformation. The “self” variety of this is held by non- trivially repeating patterns such as the Sierpinski triangle, which contains many figures that have this relation to each other. A transformation that preserves this quality is one that scales the sides of a figure, also called a dilation. For triangles, this property can be proved by the AAA theorem.

Science/Physics (Masonic 2014)<br>This concept has been more successful than Modified Newtonian [new-TOE-nee-un] dynamics at explaining the galaxy rotation problem. An equation relating average kinetic energy to potential energy called the virial [VEHR-ee-ul] theorem and observations of the Coma cluster were used by Fritz Zwicky in 1933 to predict the existence of this substance.

Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Proofs of this result sometimes make use of Liouville's Theorem that a bounded entire complex function must be constant. An early proof of this by Argand was based on earlier work by D'Alembert, while the most famous proof of it was actually faulty because it assumed the Jordan curve theorem. Early arguments over it were faulty because they did not use complex numbers or, in Leibniz's case, did not realize that the square root of i could be expressed in the form a + b i, and thus failing in the case of x to the fourth power plus one. Nearly proven in Gauss's dissertation, name this theorem that states that every polynomial of degree n with complex coefficients has n complex roots.<br>ANSWER: <u>Fundamental</u> Theorem of <u>Algebra</u> [prompt on partial answer]<br><br>6.

Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>People with this condition may display small light-colored dots on the iris, known as Brushfield spots. Heart defects and poor muscle tone are apparent in infants, and most adults with this disorder display symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by age 50. Rare mosaic and translocation varieties of it exist, though this disease is usually caused by nondisjunction in meiotic gamete production. Epicanthic folds and a single transverse crease on the palm are common, and it can be detected by karyotyping. This disease can cause hearing loss and is more likely with increased maternal age.

Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>A resistance to this hormone can be caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. The stress hormone norephinephrine inhibits it by binding to alpha-2 receptors. It increases hydrochloric acid secretion by parietal cells, lowers blood potassium levels, and causes cells to absorb more amino acids, increasing protein synthesis. Brain cells do not require it, ensuring that they will have a constant supply of fuel.

Plutonium phosphorus is an example of an actinide compound with it, and scientists have observed that lithium gas is able to exhibit this property when cooled to almost absolute zero. Long range ordering phenomena cause unpaired electrons in materials with this property to spin parallel to each other.
