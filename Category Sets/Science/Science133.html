This planet's orbit is the second-most eccentric of the planets in our Solar System. The south pole of this planet contains Swiss cheese features, and the north is dominated by the Borealis basin. Cirrus clouds form around this planet because of the sublimation of carbon dioxide from its ice caps, causing winds that also pick up dust and water vapor.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>The Wilhelmy plate method is a way of monitoring this property over time. The behavior of Bénard cells is associated with a gradient in this property, which leads to transfer of mass across an interface due to a gradient in this, also called the Marangoni effect. Alveoli try to reduce this property along their membrane, and it is the reason dew condenses into droplets rather than remains a puddle.
