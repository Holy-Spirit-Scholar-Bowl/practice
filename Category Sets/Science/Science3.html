Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>PG 1159 stars are thought to be the transition phase between planetary nebulae and one class of these objects, which, like neutron stars, cool via the emission of neutrinos in a mechanism known as the Urca process. The inability to sustain hydrogen-1 fusion characterizes a type of these objects known as “failed stars,” while electron degeneracy pressure prevents the collapse of another type until it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit.

Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>Because this process uses VKORC to recycle components, it can be inhibited by a coumarin derivative called warfarin. Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway of this process, and when endothelial cells are damaged, its von Willebrand factor bonds to collagen. This process is inhibited by Bernard-Souleir syndrome and by another disorder caused by a lack of [*] factor VIII, disrupting this process’s namesake cascade.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>Gottlob Frege [FRAY-guh] wrote that attributing this property to a statement does not add value to   the statement, which is a deflationary approach to this. Alfred Tarski believed sentences could be  judged for this quality and set out criteria for doing so. Like Kurt Gödel [GUR-dul], Tarski also wrote   that some sentences with this property could not be proved. This quality is sometimes considered  equivalent to the number one in Boolean algebra, and this is sometimes confused with validity. Name  this concept that in some approaches is used to describe statements that match reality, in contrast to  falsehood.<br>ANSWER: truth [or true]<br><br>6.
