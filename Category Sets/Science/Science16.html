1. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Neutron irradiation decreases this property in crystals, where it is more pronounced in face-centered cubic struc- tures than in body-centered ones. In alloys, this property is inversely related to carbon content, while the process of ni- triding hardens steel without diminishing this property. In general, heating enhances this property, which is measured in terms of strain or reduction in area. This property is low in lead despite that metal being very malleable, and tests for this property in metals often cause necking, which refers to the shape produced when stretching the material to its breaking or tensile point. Sometimes described as the opposite of brittleness, name this physical property which allows a substance like aluminum or copper to be drawn out into a thin wire.<br>ANSWER: <u>ductility</u> [accept word forms, <u>e.g. ductile</u>]<br><br>2.

Science/Math (BHSAT 2013)<br>The space of all operations that correspond to these motions is called SO(3). Phasors can be interpreted as vectors undergoing this motion. Gradients of scalar fields do not do this, as evidenced by the vanishment of the curl operator on those vector fields. Any motion of this type can be decomposed into three orthogonal uniaxial motions, perhaps using Euler angles, or by specifying the yaw, pitch, and roll. In spherical coordinates, these motions correspond to those in which the radius coordinate is unchanged. Where this motion exists, angular momentum is nonzero. For 10 points, name this type of motion in which a body moves about an axis but not along it.<br>ANSWER: rotation [accept circulation; or word forms; do not accept "circular motion"]<br><br>4.

Science/All (BHSAT 2009)<br>After her PhD in botany from Cornell, she moved to the University of Missouri before settling at Cold Spring Harbor Lab. While there, she studied mosaicism in the coloration of maize kernels and identified the genetic loci Dissociator  (Ds) and Activator (Ac). However, by 1953, she stopped publishing papers regarding these ―controlling elements‖ due to  rejection of the concept by her fellow geneticists.

Science/All (HSAPQ NASAT Tryout Set 2009)<br>In complete metric spaces, Cauchy sequences always have one of these. Those of a function can be found using the sandwich theorem and a typical definition is that for some delta region around x, f(x) will be within some epsilon region.

The kinematic form of this quantity, found by dividing the more common form by density, can be measured in square centimeters per second, which is a stokes. That more common form of this quantity, the dynamic type, equals shearing stress divided by velocity gradient.
