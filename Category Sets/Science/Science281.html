1. Science/Math (SCOP Novice 2013)<br><strong>This property is the defining characteristic of an Abelian [uh-BEE-lee-un] group. Composition of functions and matrix multiplication do not generally have this property. Subtraction also does </strong> not have this property because 8 minus 5 is 3, but 5 minus 8 is negative 3. For 10 points, name this property that states a+b=b+a ["a plus b equals b plus a"], that is, that swapping the order of the numbers does not change the result.<br>ANSWER: commutative property or commutativity<br><br>2. Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>Materials are prepared for use in this medium by "baking them out" to remove volatiles. The technique of sputtering is used to deposit coatings and films in the presence of this medium. A medium that is similar to this one is said to be "rarefied". This medium has zero electromagnetic susceptibility, and hence a refractive index of precisely 1, not accounting for its polarization by virtual pair production. The beam lines of particle accelerators are filled with this medium, as are cathode ray tubes. This medium is ideally characterized by having zero pressure. For 10 points, name this medium that is characterized by the absence of matter, found in outer space.<br>ANSWER: <u>vacuum</u> [or <u>free space</u>; accept <u>partial vacuum</u>]<br><br>3.

Science/All (HSAPQ NASAT Tryout Set 2009)<br>Old rubber tires often “crack” when exposed to this compound, whose concentration is reported in Dobson units. The Chapman cycle describes the production and degradation of this compound, which at low temperatures forms a dark blue liquid. It takes its name from the Greek “to smell,” and its odor can be observed during lightning strikes. In the atmosphere, this compound is broken down by compounds called chlorofluorocarbons (KLOR-oh-FLOOR-oh-CAR-buns).

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>1,3-dichloroallene exhibits the axial version of these property, and (E)-cyclooctene has the planar variety. Walden inversion, which involves this property of a molecule, can occur in reactions with an SN2  mechanism. First discovered in tartaric acid, this property is not exhibited by meso compounds, and it can be tested by a polarimeter. It occurs in tetrahedral molecules in which all four substituents are different.  Describing molecules that are non-superimposable on their mirror images, it results in enantiomers. FTP, identify this concept in chemistry often conceptualized as "handedness."<br>ANSWER: chirality<br><br>7. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>The nearest group of galaxies to it is the IC342/Maffei Group, which may have been ejected from it during their early formation. One candidate for a dark galaxy within it includes Smith’s Cloud, while the Monoceros Ring is a ring of stars within it. The membership of NGC 3109 is questionable due to its distance from the center of this entity, while the only unbarred spiral galaxy within it is the Triangulum Galaxy. The largest galaxy in it is the Andromeda Galaxy, with around a trillion stars, though Andromeda might not be the most massive. Name this group of galaxies which includes the Milky Way.<br>ANSWER: <u>Local Group</u><br><br>8. Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>This theory was used to explain a rotation known as Thomas precession. This theory exists within Minkowski space, and it gives rise to a phenomenon known as Lorentz contraction. First explained in the third of the Annus Mirabilis papers, this theory gave rise to the twin paradox, which occurs due to time dilation. Another consequence of this theory is the mass-energy equivalence, which is expressed as E=mc2 (“E” equals “M” “C” squared).

Science/Other (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2014)<br><strong>A kind of "switching" described by this word refers to the formation of a new river channel during avulsion. This letter names a function that is zero everywhere except at zero and has an integral of one over the real numbers.

Science/All (WUHSAC VIII 2006)<br>He earned the enmity of Metternich, who considered him an enormous source of problems. He was on similarly rocky terms with Cavour and the Italian monarchy, which imprisoned and exiled him.

Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>Subtypes of this process include arrhenotoky and the much more common thelytoky, and an analogous process in plants is known as apomixis. First studied in sea urchins by Jacques Loeb, the largest land animals to undergo it are Komodo dragons, while in [*] bees, it produces drones. It was used in a Tokyo lab to create the mouse Kaguya, and was artificially induced by Gregory Pincus in female rabbits of mothering age.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>The most recent proof of this theorem was provided by Georges Gonthier using the Coq assistant, while P. G.  Tait showed that it is equivalent to the statement that no snark is planar. The crucial concepts of reducibility and unavoidability were introduced in Kempe’s incorrect proof of this theorem, which can be extended to polyhedra by the Heawood conjecture. This theorem does not apply when exclaves are present, and neighbors that share only a single point do not meet this theorem’s definition of adjacency. Proven by Appel and Haken using a computer to test 1,936  distinct cases, name this theorem which gives an upper bound on the maximum number of colors required to label a contiguous map.<br>ANSWER: four-color theorem<br><br>13. Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>Free radical addition is an exception to this rule, which always produces regioselective reactions. The addition of a peroxide also prevents this rule from applying, and the formation of a carbocation intermediate is an important step in another reaction which violates this rule. That reaction is hydroboration, which proceeds according to the anti version of this rule. For ten points, idetnify this rule, the reverse of Zaitsev's rule, which states that when a protic acid is added to an alkene, the hydrogen atom gets attached to the carbon atom with the greatest number of hydrogens.<br>ANSWER: <u>Markovnikov</u>'s Rule<br><br>14. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>This concept can be used to determine the covalent portion of “all-atom” force fields, and one of its co-developers, R. J. Gillespie, has extended it to include ligand close packing among second period elements. In the 1960s, Argonne National Lab successfully applied this concept to noble gas compounds, though it unexpectedly fails for phosphine and gives out entirely at aprismatic molecules. Application of this concept often calls for the AXE method to find steric numbers, and while it cannot be used to calculate bond lengths, it does predict unusual cases like the T and see- saw. Treating multiple bonds as “superpairs”, identify this theory that uses electrostatic interaction to predict molecu- lar geometries like bent for water and tetrahedral for methane.<br>ANSWER: <u>VSEPR</u> (<u>VES</u>-<u>pur</u>) theory [or <u>valence shell electron pair repulsion</u> theory; accept <u>Gillespie</u>-<u>Nyholm</u><br><br>15.

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>When an exponent often added to generalize it is equal to gamma, the specific heat ratio, it describes any isentropic process. Deviations from this law that occur above the inversion temperature are modeled by the Joule-Thomson effect, and its constant of proportionality has units of energy and is given by the product of particle number, temperature, and the ideal gas constant.

Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>This law is the basis for a cycle that determines the lattice energies in ionic compounds, and it led to Josiah Gibb’s formulation of chemical thermodynamics. It is the basis of Born-Haber cycles, and it was created by the man who discovered the creation of saccharinic acid from oxidizing sugars.
