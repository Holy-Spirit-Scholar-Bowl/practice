1. Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>This scientist’s last patent concerned an aircraft capable of vertical take-off, and he correctly determined Earth’s resonant frequency. He designed the Wardenclyffe Tower, intended for wireless power transmission and worldwide broadcast, but that project never came to fruition, just like a charged- particle beam weapon popularly known as this man’s death ray.
