1. Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>Pairs of variables with this property are related by Pontryagin duality; that is, they are each other's Fourier transforms. Those pairs of variables with this property are generally a variable and the derivative of the action with respect to that variable; therefore, they have a lower limit on their </strong> commutators. In group theory, elements a and b in a group have this relationship if there is an element g such that g times a times the inverse of g equals b. If a polynomial with real coefficients has roots that are not real, the roots in question are two of these.

Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>When these structures have three consecutive perfect squares, they use a multiple of twenty-four, and a proof has been submitted that these structures cannot have four consecutive perfect squares. In 2004, Ben Green and Terrence Tao proved that there exist arbitrarily long lists of prime numbers that are this type of structure. These structures can be thought of as linear functions from the natural numbers to the real numbers or complex numbers. By pairing up entries from these structures, Gauss famously found a fast method to sum them when he was young.
