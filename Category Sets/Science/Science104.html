According to the Heine-Borel theorem, a set is compact if it is both bounded and this, which means it contains all of its limit points. The Cantor set, despite containing only boundary points and lacking density, has this property. Because multiplying any two integers yields another integer, the set of </strong> integers satisfies this property under multiplication. Intervals with this property include their end values and are denoted with square brackets, unlike their complement which uses parentheses.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>Proteins C and S fail to function in the absence of this molecule, which is required for the carboxylation of glutamic acid. The calcium-binding Gla domain is similarly dependent on this molecule, whose synthetic form menadione is converted menaquinone in the liver.

Science/All (NNT 2008)<br>In plants, the formation of a dense microtubule ring occurs directly before this process, and some plant cells require transverse sheets of cytoplasm called phragosomes. Recruitment of gamma tubulin helps centrosomes nucleate microtubules and those centrosomes are driven apart, eventually allowing microtubules to attach to kinetochores.

As a consequence of this theory, methane does not assume a square planar structure since that would space the bonds 90 degrees apart from each other rather than the 109 degrees in its actual shape.
