1. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>Current research is attempting to determine whether or not double-beta decay can occur without creating this particle, which would mean that these are their own antiparticles. These particles can change flavor, which is considered their oscillation. That change was verified at an observatory in Sudbury, Ontario in 2001, explaining why fewer of these were emitted by the sun than originally predicted and confirming that these objects have mass. Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines discovered the first type, and it is now known that there are three of these: tau, muon, and electron, so each of these three leptons is associated with one of the other three leptons. Name these subatomic particles unaffected by the electromagnetic or strong force, which makes them good at penetrating matter and difficult to detect.<br>ANSWER: neutrinos<br><br>2. Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>In the presence of these organisms, humans and other mammals produce large amounts of Immunoglobulin E. They are grouped on scales such as infrapopulations, metacommunities, and infracommunities, and cuckoos are the “brood” kind of these organisms since they rely on other birds to care for their young. Some members of the </strong> “endo” type of these organisms can be targeted by anthelmintic medication. Diseases caused by these kinds of organisms include elephantiasis, Lyme disease, and bubonic plague. For ten points, name these organisms which benefit to the detriment of a host organism, examples of which include tapeworms and fleas.<br>ANSWER: <u>parasite</u>s (accept <u>parasitism</u> or word forms; prompt on “worms” or “helminths” until “brood” is mentioned)<br><br>3. Science/Biology (BISB 2013)<br>One type of cell in these structures has S-type and R-type anion channels which open to depolarize the membrane after an influx of potassium ions causes a conformational shift. These structures contain a spongy, permeable membrane below the upper palisade layer of cells. Stipules are attached near the petiole of these structures. The first step of C4 carbon fixation occurs in mesophyll cells in these structures. Reticulate veins in these structures are indicative of dicots. A cuticle on these structures prevents excess water loss through transpiration, which occurs in their stomata. For 10 points, name these plant structures where photosynthesis takes place.<br>ANSWER: leaves [prompt on "plants"; prompt on "stomata"; prompt on "guard cells"]<br><br>4. Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>This is the larger of two structures in which the PAR1 region is present. CGG repeats in this structure cause partial methylation of the FMR1 gene, leading to a disease named for this structure that causes mental retardation. All but one of these structures per cell are inactivated via conversion to heterochromatin in a process called lyonization, which forms Barr bodies. While people with a trisomy of this chromosome are phenotypically normal, those with a monosomy of it present with Turner syndrome. Red-green color blindness and hemophilia are recessive traits on this chromosome. For 10 points, name this sex chromosome which is present in both women and men.<br>ANSWER: <u>X</u> chromosome<br><br>5. Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>Different values of this quantity for a nucleus at minimal energy is used to find the Yrast.  When coupling of this quantity occurs, Clebsch-Gordan coefficients are produced.  One property of this gives rise to Kepler's Second Law, also known as the law of equal areas, and that same property of this quantity about the z axis is explained in Noether's Theorem.  One definition of this quantity is the product of the moment of inertia with the angular velocity, while it is also equal to r cross p.  It explains why a spinning gyroscope does not fall over.  For 10 points each, identify this conserved quantity, often symbolized L.<br>ANSWER: <u>Angular Momentum</u><br><br>6. Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>This quantity can be determined by the negative product of the actual potential difference at a certain voltage, and the total charge on all the electrons in the system for a galvanic cell. If the actual po- tential is positive, the process will be spontaneous. At equilibrium, it can equal the product of the ideal gas constant, absolute temperature, and the natural log of the K sub e q. The quantity can also be calcu- lated by the difference between the enthalpy change of the reaction and the product of the absolute tem- perature and entropy of reaction. In this case, the reaction will always be spontaneous if the reaction is exothermic and has increasing disorder. Name this type of energy named after an American chemist that represents the amount of "usable" work that could be done by a system.<br>ANSWER: <u>Gibbs</u> free energy (prompt on partial answer)<br><br>7. Science/All (WUHSAC XI 2009)<br>Kumagai proved a version of it that holds even for level surfaces of non- differentiable functions, and economists use this result to obtain well- behaved indifference curves from utility relations. It holds for F wherever the Frechet derivative DF is non-singular, that is, where the function's Jacobian is zero, and is equivalent to the inverse mapping theorem in these locations.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>This effect is given a different name if its magnetic field is strong enough to couple the orbital and   spin angular momentums. Its size can be calculated by assuming two electrons are spinning in  opposite directions in the same plane and finding the change in velocity and therefore energy of   the electrons caused by adding a magnetic field. Because this was discovered before the concept of  electron spin was understood, a common version of it is called anomalous.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>When these data structures have a low stride they are stored contiguously in memory, which increases throughput. One of these objects is created after determining the min and max of the items to be sorted when implementing counting sort. A form of these objects are implemented using either row-major or column-major order, and full heaps can efficiently be stored using one of these data structures.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2002)<br>Only five types are necessary, since two different colors act the same as an anti-particle of the third. Between protons and electrons, their function is carried out by virtual mesons, but within a nucleon, their amplitude increases with distance, so their effect is more springlike than that of their analogues, the photons, gravitons, and W and Z bosons.

This mineral typically lacks a true crystal shape since it forms within the spaces of other crystals; that feature is due to the fact that this mineral is the last to crystallize from cooling magma, putting it at the bottom of Bowen’s reaction series. Aluminum 3 plus ions are in the smoky form of this mineral, while traces of iron gives this mineral an orange hue, a variant called citrine. Amethyst is a form of this mineral, whose piezoelectric properties allow it be used an electronic oscillator in modern clocks.
