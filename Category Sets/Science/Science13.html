Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>The polar equation theta equals this function of r produces a spira mirabilis, or golden spiral. The nth term of this function's Maclaurin series equals the quantity x minus one, quantity to the nth power, over n. This function can be in- tegrated by multiplying it by x and subtracting x, and its derivative equals the reciprocal of x. Multiplying two num- bers together and then applying this function has the same result as applying this function separately to the two num- bers and adding the results, and exponents inside these functions can instead be used to multiply outside of them.
