Science/Other (Masonic 2014)<br>In 2012, David Turner claimed that this star was significantly closer than 434 light-years away, which is the distance found by the satellite Hipparcos in the 1990s. This is the closest Cepheid [SHE-fee-id] variable to Earth, though it is actually a triple star. This can be located by drawing a line starting in Merak and going through Dubhe [DOOB-hee], and it is also at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper. This star plays a role that used to be played by Draco [DRAY-koe].

Science/All (PACE NSC 2002)<br>Discovered in 1846 just a few weeks after the planet it orbits, it moves in a retrograde orbit, which may means that it was captured by its planet after forming. Additionally, tidal interactions with its planet result in its orbit losing energy, so it is spiraling inwards.

Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>One form of this law can be written using Lame coefficients and Kronecker’s delta, and its anisotropic form can be expressed using Voigt notation. Cross-sectional area times Young’s modulus divided by length is equal to the force constant of this law that was generalized by Cauchy to three dimensions. The tendency to return to an equilibrium position is the reason for the negative sign in this law that shows stress is directly proportional to strain.
