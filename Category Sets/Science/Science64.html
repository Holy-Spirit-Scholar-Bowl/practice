Science/All (Minnesota Novice Set 2011)<br>These objects are unable to clear their own orbits but rest in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is thought that there may be two hundred of these objects, but as of now only five objects are classified as this. One of these objects, Makemake [mah-kay-mah-kay], only has an atmosphere some of the time and lacks a moon; it is found in the Kuiper Belt along with Haumea, which does have moons. These objects were defined by the IAU in 2006 and include Eris and Ceres. For 10 points, name these celestial objects that lack characteristics to be included in the eight planets, an example of which is Pluto.<br>ANSWER: <u>Dwarf planets</u><br><br>3. Science/All (RAVE 2012)<br><strong>The van’t Hoff relation states that this quantity is equal to the equilibrium pressure of a system divided by the product of concentration and temperature. In the Arrhenius equation, when activation energy is given in molecular units, this quantity, instead of the gas constant, is used. When multiplied by three-halves T it is equivalent to the </strong> average translational energy of an ideal gas, and when multiplied by the number of micro-states available to a system, this quantity gives entropy. Name this quantity, a constant equal to the gas constant divided by Avogadro’s constant, often represented by K sub B.<br>ANSWER: <u>Boltzmann</u>’s Constant [accept <u>K-sub-B</u> early]<br><br>4. Science/All (SCOP Novice 2010)<br><strong>Produced with NADH by the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, this molecule consists of a certain purine base attached to a ribose group that is attached to three namesake ions.

Science/Other (Masonic 2014)<br>This term credited to Hipparchus [hih-PAHR-kus] is still used even though his reason for using it was incorrect. Hipparchus classified objects into six classes, while one of the two modern measurements of this quantity is based on comparisons to the star Vega. To keep values on the y-axis between negative ten and positive twenty on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, astronomers use this quantity instead of luminosity. Name this quantity whose apparent and absolute values are measures of brightness.<br>ANSWER: magnitude (accept apparent magnitude or absolute magnitude)<br><br>6. Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>One process in which this quantity is constant is called a throttling process. The natural variables of this potential are pressure and entropy. Two terms must be added to the Helmholtz free energy to derive this potential. The statement that this quantity is a state function and hence can be computed using a Born-Haber cycle is known as Hess's law. Since most chemical reactions aren't conducted at constant volume, this potential is more useful than the internal energy for determining whether a reaction is exothermic. For 10 points, name this quantity typically denoted "H" that measures the heat content of a system.<br>ANSWER: <u>enthalpy</u> [accept lattice <u>enthalpy</u>; prompt on "lattice energy"; prompt on "energy"; prompt on "heat"; prompt on "H"]<br><br>7. Science/Math (SCOP Novice 2011)<br><strong>For operands that represent linear transformations, this operation represents function composition. It will yield the identity if and only if it is performed on a singular operand with its inverse. Unlike its scalar counterpart, this process does not generally </strong> commute, and it is only defined if the number of columns of the first operand equals the number of rows of the second operand. For 10 points, name this binary operation on two matrices.<br>ANSWER: matrix multiplication (accept matrix product; accept word forms or variations like multiplying matrices; prompt on multiplication or word forms thereof)<br><br>8. Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>One protecting group incorporating this element is frequently removed by the quaternary ammonium salt TBAF. Convenient variations on the aldol and Michael reactions developed by Mukaiyama employ this element in replacing the nucleophilic intermediate with a stable reagent. Rods of this material may be grown using the </strong> decomposition of its trichloro acid, in the Siemens process. This element is substituted with four methyl groups in an internal standard for NMR spectroscopy. Its dioxide forms crystals called quartz. For 10 points, name this element used to manufacture computer chips.<br>ANSWER: <u>silicon</u><br><br>9. Science/Physics (NASAT 2015)<br>A big reasons to construct active filters, usually with op-amps, is that you can eliminate this element, which you'll very rarely see in an op-amp circuit. Transforming these elements to the s-domain requires representing them in parallel with a current source that has a value of the initial current over s. In lumped element models of transmission lines, these elements occur in series with resistors. Under DC conditions, they act as a short circuit. The current in these devices cannot undergo an instantaneous change and must be continuous. They have memory because their branch current depends on the history of their branch voltage. These energystorage elements are the magnetic duals of capacitors. For 10 points, name these coiled devices whose namesake property is measured in Henrys.<br>ANSWER: ideal inductors<br><br>10. Science/All (PACE NSC 1998)<br>“The original human nature was not like the present, but different.

Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>On of his discoveries states that if atmospheric carbonic acid increases geomtrically, then the temperature will increase at a nearly arithmetic rate. In addition to his Greenhouse Law, he is the namesake of an equation that can be graphed yielding a straight line for 1 over Time versus the natural log of [*] a constant k; it includes a pre-exponential factor and relates that constant k, the rate constant of a reaction, to temperature and activation energy.

The alpha type can be polymerized by Ziegler-Natta catalysts, and their hydrohalogenation is governed by Markovnikov's rule. Highly substituted ones have Z and E isomers. Functional groups derived from compounds of this type include allyl and vinyl. Because the type of bond they have restricts rotation, these organic compounds have cis and trans isomers. Their general formula, the same as that of cycloalkanes, is CnH2n [cee en aitch two en]. Sometimes called olefins, for 10 points, name these unsaturated hydrocarbons with at least one carbon-carbon double bond, the simplest of which is ethylene.<br>ANSWER: <u>alkenes</u> (do not accept “alkane” or “alkyne”, accept “<u>olefins</u>” before mentioned)<br><br>13.

That protein, called cytochrome (SY-toe-krome) c, is essential to a transport process that ends with ATP synthase. The electron transport chain, which takes place in this organelle, uses the redox potential of NADH and FADH2 to generate ATP from fuel.

Science/All (NTV 2009)<br>Aleksander Wolszczan and Dale Frail found the first confirmed example of one these bodies using pulsar timing, but a more prolific method for their detection is the radial velocity method, which looks for changes in spectral lines due to the Doppler effect. A different method examines changes in brightness of a star due to these objects' transits. Both pulsar timing and radial velocity take advantage of small perturbations in the motion of a star due to one of these orbiting masses.

Science/All (Delta Burke 2003)<br>Assumed to have no electric charge, the first trace of these particles was discovered during the 1980s, at the electron-positron-collider, PETRA, in Hamburg, Germany; they operate only over a short range because of their massiveness; eight exist, even thogh nine would seem to exist, one for each color-anticolor pair.
