1. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>When it was first proposed, it was the "fat" type of three types of earth that together replaced one of the four main elements, a theory put forth in the 1669 work Subterranean Physics by Johann Becher. Early in the 18th century, one of Becher's students expounded on the theory and gave this substance its more common name. According to that student, Georg Ernst Stahl, it was one of the products of corrosion along with calx, </strong> known today as a metal's oxide. Its existence was defended until the beginning of the 19th century by some chemists, including Joseph Priestley, even after being discredited by Antoine Lavoisier.

Science/Biology (BISB 2013)<br>The macula densa, composed mostly of these structures, controls the GFR. These structures, which come in juxtamedullary and cortical forms, contain a long narrow region which is permeable to sodium ions but not water, called the ascending limb. The renin-angiotensin system is regulated by these structures, which are affected by antidiuretic hormone.

Like members of Placozoa, all members of this taxonomic group are placed in the subkingdom Parazoa.

Science/All (QuAC I 2008)<br>In 2000, an Indian used Eilenberg modules and Hall matchings to prove this statement, which degenerates into the Hadwiger Conjecture when n=5. Perhaps first proposed by Francis Guthrie, who lends it an alternate name, this problem was thought to be proven by the Kempe algorithm. Though it was solved by Appel and Haken in 1976 using computer-generated configurations, it turns out this theorem can be considered a special case of the Heawood conjecture, which assigns a topological space an upper limit on chromatic numbers.
