Science/All (PACE NSC 2003)<br>At any junction in a circuit, conservation of charge must be maintained, so the sum of current entering a circuit junction must equal the sum of currents exiting the junction. In addition, the algebraic sum of the increases or decreases of electrical potential around a given closed circuit loop must be zero.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>If a set of solutions to a differential equation have this property, their Wronskian [RAHN-skee-un] is nonzero.  The smallest set of vectors that span a vector space and have this property is known as a basis; this property for vectors implies that no nontrivial linear combination of them equals the zero vector. The rows of a matrix must have this quality for the matrix to be invertible. If two random variables satisfy this property, their correlation coefficient is zero, and if two events have this property, the probability of their intersection is the product of their probabilities.  Identify this property which in probability indicates that the result of one event has no effect on the result of another.<br>ANSWER: (linear or statistical) independence [accept word forms of independent]<br><br>3. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>Editor’s Note: “alkynes” rhymes with “al-fines”  Performing hydroboration on these compounds results in anti-Markovnikov addition of a hydroxyl group. Reacting mCPBA with this functional group produces epoxides in the Prilezhaev reaction. When compounds with this functional group also possess an adjacent hydroxyl group, they can tautomerize into ketones. Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used to polymerize these compounds, and a cyclic variety of one of these compounds is produced in the Birch reduction. Hydrogen gas and Lindlar’s catalyst form the cis version of these compounds from alkynes. They exhibit sp2 hybridization, and the general formula for these compounds is CnH2n. The simplest example of these compounds is ethylene. Name these compounds which contain a carbon-carbon double bond.<br>ANSWER: <u>alkene</u>s [or <u>olefin</u>s]<br><br>4. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>Poincaré stresses ensure that electrons remain stable under this principle, and the Ehrenfest paradox attempted to show that Born rigidity was not compatible with it. When combined with Maxwell’s Equations, this principle explains synchrotron light, while an important consequence of this concept created the twin paradox. This concept led to the formulation of Minkowski spacetime, and Lorentz transformations are used to calculate its effects of time dilation and length contraction. First described in the 1905 paper On the electrodynamics of moving bodies, name this theory which states that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames of reference and that mass is a measure of energy, a key work of Albert Einstein.<br>ANSWER: <u>special relativity</u> [<u>prompt</u> on <u>relativity, do not accept</u> “general relativity”]<br><br>5. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>This is the central component in a clamper circuit, which shifts a potential difference average so that it is not zero.  The first semiconductor type of this was known as a “cat’s whisker” and used in early radios. The type containing a metal–semiconductor junction can be combined with a transistor and is named for Walter Schottky. These are a type of rectifier, sometimes classified as the ones used with low power. The avalanche type is similar to the Zener type in that they both have a breakdown voltage beyond which backward current occurs, and some calculators use the light-emitting type.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>This operation was defined with respect to a general measure by Lebesgue. The Jacobian determinant is an extra factor of “r squared sine theta” required to perform this operation in spherical coordinates. It can be approximated using the Newton-Cotes formulas, Simpson’s rule, or the trapezoidal rule. It can be performed by parts or by u-substitution, and can be defined as the limit of a Riemannian sum. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates it to another operation.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>This theory predicts an increase in traveling distance proportional to the negative log of 1 minus R dot x in an effect named for Shapiro. The left side of an equation that governs this theory includes a term named for Ricci as well as a term equal to half the metric tensor times the scalar curvature. That equation is solved for by the Kerr and Schwarzschild metrics. This theory predicts that light will be deflected away from massive matter through gravitational lensing.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>The spread type of these algorithms was invented in 2002 by Steven Ross and is similar to both the bucket and radix type. One of these algorithm has best, average, and worst case run times of n log n; that one repeatedly removes the root of a heap.

Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 1 2008)<br>The Bordwell cycle extends this principle to a related quantity. The quantity that this rule concerns is the sum of internal energy and the product of pressure and volume, though that quantity, governed by this law, is better known for a change in value that is equal to TdS plus Vdp. This law may be used to calculate a compound's lattice energy via the Born-Haber cycle.

Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>This law was originally discovered by the Arabic Ibn Shal, and it can be derived from Fermat’s Least Time Principle, since a ray of light will follow a path to a point that minimizes time, not distance, causing a kinked path. The equation in this law cannot be satisfied above the “critical angle,” leading to </strong> total internal reflection, and that equation states that the ratio of the sines of two angles is proportional to the ratio of the two speeds of light.
