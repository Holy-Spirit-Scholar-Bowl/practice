Science/All (Maryland Spring 2012)<br>It isn't a photonic crystal, but the opal is a form of this type of system which can self assemble to form photonic crystals. Removal of electrostatic barriers from these systems, such as by adding salts, can lower the zeta potential and cause them to destabilize in a process called flocculation.

Multiplying their charge by one volt gives a unit of energy that is frequently used in particle physics. In an atom, the state of one of these is uniquely defined by four indices, including the spin quantum number, which exists due to the Pauli exclusion principle.
