1. Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2007)<br><strong>The biochemical conditions related to it were identified by Arvid Carlsson, who shared the 2000 Nobel in Physiology and Medicine for the work. There are currently no blood or laboratory tests that can be made to help diagnose </strong> this condition that is often characterized by akinesia, postural instability, rigidity and tremor. FTP, identify this disorder often caused by the insufficient production of dopamine and treated with L-Dopa formally documented by its namesake in 1817's An Essay on the Shaking Palsy.<br>ANSWER: <u>Parkinson's</u> Disease<br><br>2. Science/Biology (BISB 2013)<br>Cre-Lox recombination was developed for these organisms. Lathrop and Loeb's classic study on tumors was conducted in these organisms, which were used to identify the CFTR gene causing cystic fibrosis. Smithies and Capecchi pioneered an approach in which homologous DNA undergoes recombination in embryonic stem cells from these animals, producing chimera offspring. These are the animals most commonly subject to gene transgenesis and gene knockout. This was the first mammal to have its genome completely sequenced.

Science/All (Fall Novice 2009)<br>This effect's transverse form was detected by the Ives-Stillwell experiment, and Hubble used this effect to prove the expansion of the universe. This effect is used in astronomy to measure the speed of moving galaxies because the light they produce may blue shift or red shift, which are both examples of this effect. For 10 points, name this effect that explains the change in the frequency of waves as they move by an observer, typically demonstrated by a moving train.<br>ANSWER: <u>Doppler</u> effect<br><br>4. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>NASA has sent an X-ray absorption version of this device into space, and H. L. Callendar improved the tradi- tional type by adding a platinum-resistance gauge. Robert Bunsen developed the standard ice version of this device, though Laplace (luh-PLAHS) and Lavoisier had used a more primitive one in 1780 to show that respiration is a form of combustion. The Atwater-Rosa type of this device proved that the human body obeys the conservation of energy, while an adiabatic jacket surrounds the most common type, containing an ignition unit, oxygen supply, and steel bomb. Easily made in the lab from a thermometer and two coffee cups, identify this device that uses change in tem- perature to measure the heat associated with a reaction.<br>ANSWER: calorimeter<br><br>5. Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>At any given point, it consists of both a magnitude and a direction and it can be created via the dynamo mechanism and excluded from certain entities in the Meissner effect. They can be detected by the force they exert on moving electric charges, as described by the Lorentz force law, and concentrated using quadrupole focusing or solenoids. Its generation by an electric current is described by the Biot-Savart law, and its direction around a wire can be found using the right hand rule.

Science/All (HSAPQ NASAT Tryout Set 2009)<br>One class of these objects was discovered when an expected titanium dioxide absorption band was not found. These objects have fairly consistent radii because light ones are limited by Coulomb pressure, while heavier ones are limited by electron degeneracy pressure. Divided into classes like L, T, and Y, these objects can be identified via the presence of methane, and the majority of them exhibit a lithium line. These objects must be fully convective, with no difference in composition at different depths.

Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>The addition of these quantities is governed by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. This quantity is the rotational Noether two-charge, so it is conserved by systems with rotational invariance. Given in general by the wedge product of the displacement and the linear version of the same quantity, or the moment of inertia times the rotational velocity, this quantity’s time derivative is the torque. One device that exploits this quantity’s conservation is the gyroscope.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>The normal 18 electron rule does not apply to most of them; rather, they are stable with only 16 electrons due to the ligands’ location in the nodes of a bonding p orbital. Complexes of this type with 8 electrons in their d block will tend to convert to the tetrahedral form when changing from low-spin to high-spin due to Hund’s rule. They often serve as catalysts by means of oxidative addition due to the two vacant sites relative to a filled octahedron, with respect to which their dz-squared orbital’s energy is lowered. For 10 points, name this flat type of geometry often found in coordination complexes.<br>ANSWER: <u>Square planar</u> complexes<br><br>11. Science/Other (SCOP Novice 2012)<br><strong>The fragments of one of these celestial objects named for Kreutz have orbits that "graze" the Sun. One of these objects named for Encke has a period of only 3.3 years, and fragments from another of these objects become </strong> Perseid meteors. Solar radiation creates a dusty coma around these bodies; the solar wind then acts on that dust, forming a tail.

Science/All (Ohio State/VCU housewrite 2012)<br><strong>The Wassermann test is used to diagnose this disease.  Modern treatment of it is usually with penicillin, which leads to the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction as the infectious agents are killed.  Paul Ehrlich created Salvasan to treat this disease while looking for a “magic bullet” to cure sleeping sickness.

Science/Math (BISB 2013)<br>On a phase portrait, the eigenvectors serve as these, and spiral points may be stable with respect to them. These act as essential discontinuities, in contrast with "removable" and "jump" discontinuities. Their slope equals plus or minus b over a for a hyperbola in standard form. The graph of the arctangent x or of a logistic curve will have two of these. "Oblique" or "slant" ones occur when the degree of the numerator of a rational function is greater than the degree of the denominator.
