1. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>The symmetry group of this figure is O(2,R) (“oh two R”). It has constant finite curvature, and the power-of-a-point theorem relates the lengths of certain line segments constructed relative to a point and one of these figures. The shortest path between two points on a sphere is along a “great” one of these. These conic sections with eccentricity 0 can be graphed parametrically as “x equals r cosine theta” and “y equals r sine theta,” or in polar coordinates as “r equals a constant.” The equation “x squared plus y squared equals 1” describes the “unit” one of these.
