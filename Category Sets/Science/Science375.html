1. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>Many plants in this biome use cauliflory to aid in seed dispersal. The theory of Pleistocene refugia   explains its diversity of bird species. Ants produce devil’s gardens in one region of this biome, and  another region’s fauna are separated by Wallace’s line. Despite a high rate of decomposition, only   10% of nutrients are retained in this biome’s soil, forcing slash-and-burn techniques to be used when  this land is converted for agriculture. Lianas and epiphytes are common in this biome, while the  largest species form a canopy where animals like birds of paradise, monkeys, and sloths live.

Science/Biology (Masonic 2014)<br>The inclusive type of this property is addressed by Hamilton's Rule, which multiplies the benefit to the recipient of an altruistic act by the genetic relatedness to the actor. An example of the inclusive type of this property is kin selection, and this is used to explain the continued existence of bees, ants, and other organisms studied by sociobiologists. The absolute measure of this property is the ratio of the number of individuals after and before selection. Name this quality of certain populations to survive and reproduce.<br>ANSWER: (Darwinian or evolutionary) fitness (accept adaptive value, selective value, or adaptability, prompt on ability to "survive" or "altruism")<br><br>3. Science/All (BDAT I 2011)<br><strong>A depolarizing agent is absent when these devices begin to leak out hydrogen gas, a signal that they fail in motherboards in a namesake “plague.” Another type of these devices uses electrolytes to improve its performance.

Thomson and invented by Francis William Aston, for 10 points, what instrument in chemistry can thus analyze a sample to identify various isotopes of a specific element?<br>ANSWER: <u>Mass Spect rometer</u><br><br>6. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This law is apparently contradicted by the Poincaré recurrence theorem. The Gibbs paradox deals with apparent violations of this law. Rudolf Clausius stated this law as saying that heat cannot spontaneously flow from a cold body to a hotter body. A hypothetical creature which can separate fast molecules and slow molecules, Maxwell's demon, would violate this law. For 10 points, name this law which says that the entropy of an insulated system never decreases.<br>ANSWER: second law of thermodynamics<br><br>7. Science/Chemistry (BHSAT 2013)<br>In one form of this technique, analytes are said to elute from the apparatus. In a modern version of that form, liquids are forced through a sorbent column at high pressure. One common setup applies it to a gas before performing mass spectrometry. The retention factor measures the relative distance traveled by an analyte in one variety of this technique, in which a thin adsorbent layer often made of silica acts as a stationary phase. Another variety of it was seminally used to separate plant pigments for the first time; in that variety, various components of a plant extract rise up a paper at different speeds.

Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>This process consists of the extrinsic pathway followed by the intrinsic pathway, which produces kallikrein (kal-ih-KREE-in). Those two pathways are this process’s namesake "cascade." Those who cannot do it may suffer from Christmas disease or a defective von Willebrand factor. It converts fibrinogen, or Factor 1, to fibrin, which polymerizes (puh-LIM-uh-"rises") to form a thrombus. A defect in Factor 8 of this process causes hemophilia A, which is the inability of the body to perform this process. It is also called coagulation.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>Common file extensions found in this system are .bz2, .rpm, and .tar. Hard links in this are different from soft links in that they are not shortcuts to other files, and changes made to hard links are applied to all other instances of a file, regardless of filename. A shell is a special program used to communicate with this through text-based commands, and it traces its ancestry to the mainframe operating system MULTICS.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>Before the honeycomb conjecture, these shapes were the subject of Thomas Hales’ proof of the Kepler   conjecture, which gives the most efficient way to pack these shapes into a space. A set consisting  of the complex numbers and a point at infinity is called the Riemann type of this shape. It can   be generated in cylindrical coordinates by setting 𝑟 2 + 𝑧 2 [“𝑟  squared plus 𝑧  squared”] equal to a constant, and this shape can be generated in a coordinate system named for it by setting rho equal  to a constant.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>In 1697, David Gregory wrote a comprehensive treatise on this shape, and a challenge in Acta Eruditorum to find its equation prompted solutions from Huygens (HOY-gunz), Leibniz, and Johann Bernoulli. Euler (OY-lur) proved that this shape produces the surface of revolution with minimum area, while a road pitted with a continuous series of these curves will allow a square wheel to roll smoothly. This curve is traced by the focus of a parabola as it rolls along a straight line, and it is asymptotic to graphs of both exponential growth and exponential decay. Because it eliminates shear forces at joints and causes weight to be directed down into the ground rather than at an angle, Robert Hooke determined that this is the optimal shape of an arch.
