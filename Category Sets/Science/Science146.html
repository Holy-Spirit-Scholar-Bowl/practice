1. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>Because of its dielectric properties, it is used as a material for printed circuit boards in microwave applications. Its synthesis by emulsion polymerization requires a surfactant, usually PFOA. This polymer has a coefficient of friction of less than 0.1, the lowest of any known solid, making it ideal as a lubricant. When bound to fabric fibers, it can repel stains. It is sometimes referred to by an abbreviation of its IUPAC name, PTFE, but it is most commonly known by a brand name owned by DuPont.
