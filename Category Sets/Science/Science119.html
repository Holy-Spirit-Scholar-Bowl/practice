1. Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2005)<br>In the 1940’s and 1950’s, this theory was improved using new developments in valence bond theory and observations of atomic electronegativities to build upon the Lewis model of covalent bonding. Based upon the idea that molecular shape can be primarily determined by electron repulsion, it categorizes molecules into shapes such as linear, trigonal planar, and pyramidal. For 10 points, name this theory of molecular geometries with a five-letter abbreviation.<br>ANSWER: <u>v</u>alence <u>s</u>hell <u>e</u>lectron <u>p</u>air <u>r</u>epulsion Theory<br><br>2.

Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>The Lepore form of this protein is linked to silent strokes. This protein is improperly oxidized in children who ingest nitrates.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>The fundamental interaction mediated by this particle is described by the U(1) symmetry group. These particles form bosonic quasiparticles called polaritons when they interact with dipole excitations. Neutral pions mostly decay into two of these particles, whose scattering from electrons has a cross section given by the </strong> Klein-Nishina formula. Interactions of two of these particles at high energies can create electrons and positrons through pair production, and these particles are produced in matter-antimatter annihilations.

Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>This process may have "Forced Moves" or "Good Tricks" according to a book that likens a theory of it to a "universal acid." That theory of this process is dismissed in a 1907 book that proposes the élan vital (vee-TAHL) as a source of human culture. Daniel Dennett called this process a "Dangerous Idea" in a book named after its formulator, and a "creative" form of it was posited by Henri Bergson. The </strong> Wilberforce-Huxley Debate centered on a book that popularized this concept, which borrows a term from Herbert Spencer to propose a mechanism for common descent. Its creator applied this theory to humans in The Descent of Man.

Some that are lit internally or from the side are easily observable, such as the one below Orion's belt. Some are remnants of supernovas, while others are the earliest stages of star and planetary formation.
