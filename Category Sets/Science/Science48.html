It is in a steel chamber with a device described as follows: a Geiger counter contains a tiny bit of substance that has a fifty percent chance of decaying over the course of an hour, and if that substance decays a flask of hydrocyanic acid is shattered. Quantum mechanics must describe the state of the substance using superposition, but it does not make sense to describe the state of this animal the same way.

A reduced production of this protein's alpha or beta side chains leads to Thalassemia, a defect in the synthesis of this protein.

Science/All (NTV 2009)<br>These clouds were photographed in the Martian atmosphere by the NASA rover Opportunity. On Earth, the scarcity of water vapor where they are usually located gives them their namesake shape. These clouds' presence can signal the approach of precipitation, but the clouds themselves do not yield any. Their wispy, strand-like appearance lends them the nickname “mare's tail”, and they signal wind direction via their orientation. Identify these highest of clouds, with a Latin name meaning “curl of hair.”<br>ANSWER: <u>cirrus</u> clouds [prompt on <u>mare's tail</u> before it is mentioned; do not accept or prompt on “<u>cirrostratus</u>” or<br><br>12.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>The absolute square, also known as the squared norm, is defined as the namesake modulus of one of these, squared. Gerolamo Cardano conceived of these numbers due to a conundrum in the solution in radicals of cubic equations. These are represented by exponents in phasor form, and quaternions are an extension of these. Their namesake plane is also called the Argand plane, and their polar form may utilize the cis function.

Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>A technique that uses high energy ions to determine the properties of a material uses this process and is called Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy. Objects undergoing this process have a coefficient of restitution of 1 and effective neutron moderators essentially work by undergoing this process. Space exploration vessels using a slingshot orbit undergo this process with gravity and the large return height of the smaller ball of the double ball experiment is due to this process.
