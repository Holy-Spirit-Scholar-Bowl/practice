By binding to receptors in plasma membranes of uninfected cells, they prevent viral reproduction inside infected cells via a signaling pathway. They are one of the first nonspecific lines of defense against viruses.

Science/All (BHSAT 2009)<br>The most abundant genus within this phylum or subdivision is commonly known as Bracken. Members of that genus  often play an important role in succession in subtropical regions and are particularly resilient weeds because of their  sturdy rhizomes. Their gametophytes tend to die after their sporophytes detach to disperse spores, a process which is  aided by the presence of springy sporangia. Members of this group are notable for possessing megaphylls, unlike other  seedless vascular plants, and their leaves, or fronds, can only open after their fiddleheads uncurl. FTP, name these  seedless vascular plants.<br>ANSWER: ferns (also accept Pteridophyta or Filicophyta)<br><br>3. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>One of these organisms, Tesnusocaris goldichi, possessed uniramous instead of biramous appendages. One structure that characterizes this phylum undergoes apolysis and ecdysis and is composed of proteins like resilin or sclerotin interwoven with fibrous alpha-chitin. That structure, often mineralized with calcium carbonate, is a cuticle. Animals in this phylum uptake waste from their hemolymph using Malpighian tubules and also possess open circulatory systems and jointed legs.

Science/Physics (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>One result of this is that objects feel heavier or lighter depending on direction of motion, which is known as the Eötvös effect. The Ekman spiral is caused by this, and the ratio of inertial forces to forces caused by it is known as the Rossby number. Acceleration due to this effect is equal to negative two times the cross product of the system's angular velocity and the particle's velocity. It is directed radially inward for high pressure systems, and cyclones rarely form at the equator due to the absence of this effect.
