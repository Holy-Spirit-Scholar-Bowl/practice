1. Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>He wrote the third set of objections to Descartes’ Meditations, in which he argued against Cartesian immaterialism. His own metaphysical views were expounded in a work called De corpore, which constituted part of a trilogy with De homine and De cive. The last of those was a concise statement of his political views, which he described at greater length in a 1651 work. For 10 points, name this man who argued that life is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” in the state of nature in his Leviathan.<br>ANSWER: Thomas <u>Hobbes</u><br><br>2. Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>About 900 kilometers wide and transporting only about 350 to 700 billion cubic feet of water per second, it is similar to its analog in the North Pacific. Extensive upwelling results in an abundance of nutrients at the surface, making for excellent fishing grounds. This upwelling only intensifies the cold flow that results from this phenomenon, which increases the aridity of the coasts of Chile and Ecuador. For 10 points, name this ocean current off the coast of Peru, named for the German meteorologist who discovered it.<br>ANSWER: <u>Humboldt</u> current [accept <u>Peru</u> current before it is mentioned]<br><br>3. Science/All (WUHSAC XI 2009)<br>The 1993 Nobel Prize was given for the discovery of a binary system with a pulsar, which indirectly confirmed the existence of these. Einstein’s equations predict that they will be produced by any accelerating object which is not spherically or cylindrically symmetric. LISA, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, is a planned system of three satellites which would use lasers to detect them directly, as they would cause minute changes in the relative positions of the satellites. FTP, name these phenomena predicted by general relativity, which are a non-electromagnetic form of radiation.<br>ANSWER: <u>Gravitational Waves</u> or <u>Gravitational Radiation</u><br><br>4. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>This quantity is inversely proportional to temperature by Wien's Law. The ratio of this quantity for light in two different media is the reciprocal of the ratio of the media's indices of refraction. Planck's constant divided by the product of mass and velocity is sometimes known as the "de Broglie" one. It is lower for ultraviolet light than visible light and higher for infrared, and is typically denoted with the Greek letter lambda. For 10 points, name this quantity, equal to the velocity divided by frequency, the distance between two peaks of a periodic wave.<br>ANSWER: <u>wavelength</u> [accept <u>lambda</u> before it is read]<br><br>5. Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament 2010)<br>This phenomenon may be classified by a disdrometer. Radar reflectivity is proportional to the sixth power of the particles involved in this phenomenon. The Bergeron process leads to this phenomenon via coalescence. The Köppen climate classification system depends on temperature and on the quantity of this phenomenon in an area.

Science/All (MW GSAC XVII 2009)<br>This organelle manufactures the polysaccharide pectin, which is used in plant cell walls. Vesicles bound for this organelle are covered in Coat Protein II, and it adds mannose-6-phosphate signals to mark enzymes which will be sent to lysosomes. In the maturation model, its cisternae move from the cis to the trans face before being degraded into vesicles. Its primary role is to process and modify molecules it receives from the ER. For 10 points, name this cellular organelle which is named for an Italian scientist.<br>ANSWER: <u>Golgi</u> Apparatus [or <u>Body</u> or <u>Complex</u> or <u>Dictyosome</u>]<br><br>7. Science/Physics (BISB 2013)<br>This phenomenon is not observed in a thin film if the thickness times the index of refraction is a half-integer multiple of wavelength. This phenomenon introduces "s-polarization" at an angle equal to the arctangent of the ratios of the indies of refraction, at Brewster's angle. It can be "specular" or "diffuse." Above the critical angle, the sparkle of diamonds occurs due to the "total internal" form of this phenomenon. In general, this phenomenon results in an angle symmetric to the angle of incidence, with respect to the normal.

Science/All (SCOP Novice 2010)<br><strong>If one of these structures lacks zero as an eigenvalue, it is nonsingular, and the reduced row-echelon form of these entities is computed in Gauss-Jordan elimination. If conformable, they feature non-commutative multiplication, and reflecting one of them over its main diagonal creates its transpose. They are invertible if and only if their </strong> determinant does not equal zero; that calculation is written as A times D minus B times C for the two-by-two type of this construct. Name this mathematical construct, a rectangular array of elements.<br>ANSWER: <u>matrix</u>/ces [accept square <u>matrix</u> before "Gauss-Jordan elimination"]<br><br>9. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>Upon rediscovering this object in 1612, Simon Marius said that it glowed like a candle seen through   a horn. Its first discoverer, who described it as a small cloud, was Abd al- Rahman al-Sufi. This  can be located using Alpheratz and Mirach, two stars in the constellation that shares this object’s   name. The discovery of Cepheid [SEF-ee-id] variables inside this object by Edwin Hubble settled  the Shapley-Curtis Debate, proving that this object is not a nebula and establishing the existence of  galaxies outside the Milky Way.

Science/Physics (BHSAT 2013)<br>Hideki Yukawa estimated the range of this phenomenon to be about one fermi by modeling it as an exchange of neutral pions. It imparts over 99% of the mass of a certain 938-MeV particle. It is described by the gauge group SU(3). Since the theory describing it has running coupling constants, it cannot be solved perturbatively at low energy, giving rise to asymptotic freedom. At high energies, it exhibits confinement. Its bosons carry color charge and might couple to one another, forming glueballs. For 10 points, name this fundamental force described by quantum chromodynamics, which is mediated by gluons and holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus.<br>ANSWER: strong nuclear force [or strong interaction; or quantum chromodynamics or QCD until "force" is read]<br><br>11. Science/Physics (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>One set of mathematical constructs named for this man are Hermitian and unitary, and thus correspond to the observables of the complex Hilbert space with two dimensions. This man used the conservation of energy and momentum in beta decay to theorize the existence of the neutrino. He names a set of three matrices that describe spin, and one of his results explains why neutron stars below the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit don't collapse. That principle concerns the anti-symmetric quantum states of fermions, explaining why electrons with the same spin cannot occupy the same orbital.

Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>The inhibitor GRN163L binds to the RNA template of these.  In humans this enzyme is made up partly of TERT, which has a coding region 3396 base pairs long.  A therapy using this enzyme is being used in new cancer treatments because scientists in a Dallas hospital detected it in 90 of 101 tumor samples but in none of the 50 normal tissue samples. This enzyme has been shown to add the TTAGGG sequence to DNA in the 3-prime region of vertebrates, and is a reverse transcriptase. This enzyme allows for the replacement of lost bits of DNA, and without it cells will reach their Hayflick limit. When it is dormant in cells they will become unstable and eventually die.  FTP, name this enzyme that works on the telomeres.<br>ANSWER: <u>Telomerase</u><br><br>14.

A “riparian zone” refers to the interface between one of these entities and the surrounding land. These entities transport their bed load by processes like saltation. Meanders in these structures can become cut off and form oxbow lakes. Younger ones tend to exhibit steeper banks and fewer tributaries, and these entities terminate in deltas.

Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>Generalizations of this problem include the Hadwiger Conjecture, and Apollonian networks have a unique solution to this problem. The 15-node Poussin graph exhibited a flaw in a supposed proof of this statement by “tangling” Kempe chains, but Heawood used Kempe’s work to prove a 25% weaker bound on this problem. The proof of this conjecture required verifying </strong> 1,936 separate cases. It was finally proven in 1976 by Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel with the aid of a computer.
