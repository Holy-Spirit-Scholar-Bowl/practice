Science/Chemistry (Maggie Walker GSAC 2010)<br>A class of enzymes named for this phenomenon includes gyrase and is divided into type I and type II based on how they convert DNA between forms exhibiting this phenomenon. A functional group's occupation of the axial or equatorial positions on cyclic molecules and the inability of molecules to rotate about a double bond give rise to the cis-trans type of this phenomenon, and non-superposable mirror images called enantiomers exemplify the "stereo" variety.
