1. Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>The same empirical equation as this one substituted with the reversible potential yields the Butler-Volmer equation. One can derive this equation using a set of reaction probabilities in addition to using Boltzmann factors. In the case of only one present ion, it can be obtained from the Goldman- Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation. Because overpotential can complicate this equation, it is only functional when there is no net charge flwoing through the circuit. For ten points, identify this equation used to find the electrical potential of a cell, which is named for a German chemist.<br>ANSWER: <u>Nernst</u> Equation<br><br>2. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>One region in this structure is the site of BMAL-1-CLOCK dimerization and is located above the optic chiasm. The lateral and posterior portions of this structure produce orexins, deficits of which can lead to narcolepsy. The hypophyseal portal system connects this structure to the HPA axis. Contained in the diencephalon, it releases GHRH and CRH, as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone, somatostatin, oxytocin, and vasopressin.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>A cataclysmic variable is one of these in which luminosity is variable due to accretion, until the system destroys itself. The orbits of these objects are observed to decay in a manner consistent with the existence of gravitational waves, which is a proof of general relativity, and the region of space in which a mass is bound to one of the component stars of this is known as the Roche lobe.

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>Richard Dawkins referred to this man‟s namesake teapot in order to show that one did not have to prove that God did not exist. He was a noted pacifist, protesting everything from World War I to the Vietnam War, and also spoke out against nuclear proliferation and Soviet totalitarianism. He is considered a founder of analytic philosophy, though his attempt to resolve all problems of mathematics was destroyed by Gödel, and his assertions that philosophy could create new knowledge was refuted by his greatest student Ludwig Wittgenstein. This man‟s namesake paradox concerns the set of all sets that are not members of themselves and his most famous popular works include “What I Believe”, Problems of Philosophy, and Why I am Not a Christian. For ten points, name this British philosopher who wrote Principia Mathematica together with Alfred North Whitehead.<br>ANSWER: Bertrand Russell<br><br>6. Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>One body in this classification contains a notable amount of methane and is named after the god of fertility from the religion of the Easter Island inhabitants because of its previous designation Easter Bunny, while another formerly known as Santa is known for its ellipsoid shape; those two,  Makemake and Haumea, are also classified as plutoids.

Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XVI 2008)<br>|  Although this process does not occur naturally in mammals, Gregory Pincus artificially induced this in a rabbit. When certain bees become infected with a bacterium of the genus Wolbachia, they start to undergo this process, which is more famously employed by certain types of lizards such as the Komodo Dragon. However, this process does not occur in hermaphroditic species, because they have both sex organs. Coming from the Greek for “virgin birth,” this is, FTP, what process, by which females produce offspring without male fertilization of eggs.          |<br>ANSWER: <u>Parthenogenesis</u><br><br>8. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2010)<br>AXPs and SGRs are probably a type of these objects with a strong magnetic field. Crust adjustments lead to starquakes in these objects, which increase in rotational speed during spin-ups and glitches. With a mass bounded by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, these stars are usually remnants of a core-collapse supernova. Magnetars are a subtype of one kind, which rotates rapidly and emits a pulse of electromagnetic radiation; that subtype is the pulsar.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>In a Carnot engine, entering heat times one minus the ratio of the temperatures of the resevoirs is equal to this quantity.

Cells of this  process in the atmosphere include the Hadley cell and the polar vortex. One subtype of this  process transports substances using the fluid’s bulk motion in a particular direction - that type is  called advection.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>One derivative of this vitamin is a cofactor in the enzyme complex mutated in Maple Syrup Urine Disease. One derivative of this vitamin called TPP helps catalyze the decarboxylation of pyruvate before it is transformed into acetyl- CoA. A deficiency of this vitamin in chronic alcoholics leads to Wernicke- Korsakoff syndrome. This vitamin plays a role in the biosynthesis of GABA, and along with Vitamin B7, this is one of the only two sulfur-containing vitamins. This vitamin was first named aneurin because of the severe neurological effects when it was lacking in the diet. Because members of the Japenese navy ate a diet consisting of polished white rice, they were subject to the most notable form of this vitamin’s deficiency.

Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>This theory originated as an offshoot of Ernst Mayr's concept of genetic revolutions by speciation, but was greatly expanded by the author of a 1971 paper citing fossil records of trilobites, Niles Eldredge, as well as Stephen Jay Gould. It opposes the phylectic type of another idea and explains the lack of transitional forms in fossil records. Stating that most sexually reproducing species experience little change for most of their history and that their evolution occurs in short, rapid spurts is, for ten points, what evolutionary theory often contrasted with phylectic gradualism?<br>ANSWER: <u>punctuated equilibrium</u><br><br>16.
