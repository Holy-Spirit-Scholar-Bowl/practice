Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>Aluminum hydroxide in solution has this property because of the partially covalent bond be- tween the hydroxide ion and aluminum ion. In basic solution, aluminum hydroxide becomes a Lewis acid because it accepts a pair of electrons. In acid, it absorbs protons.

Science/Physics (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>A principle of this theory would be violated by the Nordtvedt effect, which has likely been ruled out by the Lunar Laser Ranging experiment. A consequence of the use of torsion-free linear connections in this theory is the Bianchi identities.

The "weak" form of a principle of this theory states that freely falling particles move on timelike geodesics.
