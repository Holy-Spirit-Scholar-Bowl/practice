This experiment used three spacer balls to separate the plates of its capacitor, which usually reached a potential of about three thousand volts. The fundamental technique of this experiment was to balance the force of gravity with the forces of buoyancy and viscosity, but its result was off by about six percent due mostly to an incorrect value used for the viscosity of air.
