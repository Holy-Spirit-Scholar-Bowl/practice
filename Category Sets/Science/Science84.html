1. Science/All (JAMES 2013)<br><strong>Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is caused by a problem in this organelle, which has also been suggested as a possible cause of aging. This organelle transfers substances across its inner membrane through a TIM/TOM complex, and it is thought to have developed from </strong> proteobacteria according to the endosymbiotic theory. This double-membraned organelle self-replicates during mitosis and meiosis and contains its own DNA, RNA, and ribosomes. The electron transport chain is embedded in the cristae of this organelle, and the Krebs cycle occurs in its matrix.

Science/Physics (PACE NSC 2015)<br><strong>This scientist is the first namesake of a strip reaction in which a deuterium nucleus gives a neutron to a heavier nucleus, causing the release of a proton. A Physical Review paper written by Hartland Snyder and this physicist provided the modern concept of a black hole.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br><strong>The Oren-Nayar model describes the diffuse of this phenomonenon, which is assumed to be Lambertian in simple models, and which occurs when surfaces are not smooth.
