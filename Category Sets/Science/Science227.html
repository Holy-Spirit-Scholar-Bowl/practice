1. Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2004)<br>Removal of carbon dioxide in this process occurs as a result of two important dehydrogenase pathways, one of which follows the formation of α-ketoglutarate [“alpha” key-tow-GLUE-ter-ate]. That step precedes the lyase [LIE-ace] action on malate to produce fumarate, although succinate [SUH-sin- ate] is considered to be its most important intermediate. Eventually, fumarate is converted to oxaloacetate [ox-all-oh-ASS-uh-tate], which combines with the pyruvate derivative acetyl-CoA [co eh] to restart, for ten points, what cycle of respiration, named for either its first product or for a German biochemist?<br>ANSWER: <u>citric acid</u> cycle (or <u>Krebs</u> cycle)<br><br>2. Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>The statistical mechanics derivation of this equation assumes an interparticle potential inversely proportional to distance to the sixth power. Maxwell used an equal area rule to correct for an error in this equation, which can be written in terms of the cube of the volume and is a simplification of the virial equation. It involves two gas-dependent parameters, the first dependent on interparticle attractive forces and the second on the proper volume of gas particles. Those are commonly written as a and b.
