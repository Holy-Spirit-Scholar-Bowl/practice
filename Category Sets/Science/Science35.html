Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>In hyperbolic geometry there are two forms of this geometric configuration, ultra and limiting. In Euclidean ge- ometry it is the degenerate conic section found by the limiting case as the focal distance goes to infinity while the verti- ces remain constant of a hyperbola. This degenerate conic can also be seen as the intersection of a plane and double cone when the vertex of the cone is moved to a point at infinity making the cone into a cylinder. In projective geome- try, this configuration cannot exist. Solutions in the coordinate plane to the equation y squared equals one provide an algebraic description to this configuration. This configuration also exists in the graph of an inconsistent system of two linear equations--that outcome arises when the two lines have the same slope.
