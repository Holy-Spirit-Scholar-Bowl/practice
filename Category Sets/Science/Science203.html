Science/Biology (NTSS 2013)<br>Angelman syndrome results from this type of inheritance due to paternal imprinting, and this concept has been used to explain why the children of women pregnant during the Dutch famine of 1944 show a greater incidence of obesity and diabetes. This mode of inheritance for the mouse agouti gene can produce identical twins with different coat colors and is not thought to exist in plants, most of whose cells remain totipotent.
