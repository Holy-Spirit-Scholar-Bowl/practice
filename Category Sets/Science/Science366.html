Science/Math (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2014)<br><strong>Removing these numbers from Pascal's triangle results in the formation of Sierpinski's triangle. This property is possessed by the degrees of all the vertices in an Eulerian graph. It is hypothesized that all perfect numbers also satisfy this condition, and these types of numbers can be expressed as the sum of two </strong> prime numbers according to Goldbach's Conjecture. This property applies to functions such as x squared and cosine because those functions are symmetrical about the y-axis. In binary, these numbers have an end digit of zero because they are all multiples of two. For ten points, identify this property possessed by numbers which are not odd.<br>ANSWER: even<br><br>3.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>The axiom of this concept states that for any set there exists a set whose elements are the elements of the elements of the first set. The unsorted and usual types of this operation remove repetition from a list, while the discriminated or disjoint type of this create an index giving information about the source of each element. The symmetric difference gives a subset of the result of this operation. When this operation is applied to two sets, the resulting cardinality is at least the higher cardinality of the two original sets and at most the sum of the cardinalities. The inclusion-exclusion principle states that the cardinality of this is the sum of the cardinalities of the inputs, minus the cardinality of the intersection.
