A mixture for which this property is lower than for either of the constituent parts is called a positive azeotrope. This property can be bypassed by a process analogous to supersaturation, which can lead to violent eruptions upon adding nucleation sites.

One can easily the angular velocity of each section of the object undergoing this type of motion because a certain point is always stationary. This type of motion is useful because an object undergoing it experiences static friction even though it is in motion; this advantage occurs because the rolling object is in contact with a single point of the surface on which it rolls, and that point of contact is instantaneously stationary at all times.
