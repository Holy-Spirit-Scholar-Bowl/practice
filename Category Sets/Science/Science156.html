Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>This person developed a theorem, now named for him and Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen, stating that magnetism cannot be explained by classical and statistical physics. He is also the namesake of a constant equal to the magnitude of an electron’s spin magnetic moment. Early quantum mechanics used models named for Arnold Sommerfeld and this person, based on the idea that electrons have circular orbitals. Werner Heisenberg and this person were associated with the idea that objects governed by quantum mechanics create experimental results dependent on measurement, which was known as complementarity and became known as the Copenhagen interpretation.
