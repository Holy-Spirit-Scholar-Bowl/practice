1. Science/All (Ohio State/VCU housewrite 2012)<br><strong>David Baltimore names a classification scheme for these organisms and also discovered an enzyme used by one type of these organisms. A model organism for these organisms was discovered by Esther Lederberg. The DNA of one of these organisms was labeled with radioactive phosphorus while their protein coat was labeled with radioactive sulfur in the </strong> Hershey-Chase experiment. That organism was the T2 phage and that protein coat is their capsid. Another type of these organisms uses the reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA from its RNA genome and is their "retro-" type.

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>The Clausius-Clapeyron equation makes use of a type of enthalpy associated with this value. Since this value is constant for a mixture of liquids in an azeotrope, fractional distillation cannot be applied to such a system. It occurs when the vapor pressure of a liquid equals the </strong> atmospheric pressure, and the "elevation" of this quantity is a colligative property, similar to freezing point depression. On his temperature scale, Anders Celsius set this value for water as 100 degrees. For 10 points, name this temperature at which a phase change from liquid to gas occurs.<br>ANSWER: boiling point [prompt on boiling; prompt on vaporization]<br><br>3. Science/Math (Masonic 2014)<br>In set theory, this number can be defined using the set that contains only zero. If a function approaches this positive value raised to infinity, then it is indeterminate. This number equals the length of each vector in an orthonormal basis. This is the only positive number that cannot be used as the base of a logarithm, and this is the only positive number equal to its own reciprocal. Name this number that is the multiplicative identity.<br>ANSWER: one<br><br>4. Science/All (BHSAT 2011)<br>For large numbers, it’s often estimated by n log n minus n, or by the square root of 2 pi n times quantity n over e to the n; those approximations are named for Stirling. Its value at one-half is the square root of pi when extended to complex numbers by the gamma function. It gives the number of permutations, or ways to order a list of n elements, and its additive analogue is the nth triangular number.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>Those who suffer from it often have a thick, backwards projecting corpus callosum. It is not Down Syndrome, but sufferers tend to have epicanthal folds, an upturned nose, and microcephaly. This disorder, prevalent on Native American reservations, is also linked to ADHD, as this disorder negatively affects the sufferer’s ability to control his or her actions.

Science/Chemistry (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>The first of these type of materials was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1833 when he was studying the properties of silver sulfide. Frenkel excitons generally form in these materials when they are exposed to photons that have energies in or near the visible range of the spectrum. These materials observe an increase in resistivity when they are cooled, unlike metals such as copper. Graphite behaves like one of these because of its extensive pi- delocalization, allowing access to conduction bands. Conductivity of these materials is modified by doping.

Science/Math (Masonic 2014)<br>These numbers can be generated by adding successive powers of two until the sum is prime and then multiplying that prime times the last number added. That method is the only successful one ever used to find these numbers. That method, stated by Euclid [YOO-klid], gives the relationship between these numbers and Mersenne [mer-sen] numbers. These whole numbers, which are not superabundant or deficient, have no known odd examples. Name these numbers that equal the sum of their proper divisors.<br>ANSWER: perfect numbers<br><br>9. Science/All (Fall Novice 2009)<br>This algorithm is sometimes implemented with a switch to a heap-based approach at a sufficiently deep level of recursion. This solves the problem that when operating on an array that is already in order, this algorithm degenerates to n squared running time.
