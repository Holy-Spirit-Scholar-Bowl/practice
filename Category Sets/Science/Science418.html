1. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>In addition to the respiratory and circulatory systems, this system obeys Murray's law. Cells found in this system include tracheids and vessel elements, the latter of which generally do not appear in gymnosperms. The flow of its namesake sap is driven primarily by transpirational pull, but also by root pressure. It is often contrasted with a type of tissue which transports sugars. For 10 points, name this plant tissue which transports water, contrasted with phloem.<br>ANSWER: <u>xylem</u><br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 3 2008)<br><strong>Supersymmetry predicts a much larger value than the standard model for this particle's electric dipole moment. These particles undergo a decay process involving the emission of a W-minus boson, lasting only around fifteen minutes in their free form. That process is beta-minus decay, and nuclear fission occurs via </strong> bombardment by these particles. They consist of an up quark and two down quarks and were discovered by James Chadwick in 1932, helping to explain atomic mass. For 10 points, name these uncharged particles, found with protons in the atomic nucleus.<br>ANSWER: neutrons<br><br>3. Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>This object’s action was compared to a photon moving through a semiconductor by Yochiro Nambu. This particle can be formed by the annihilation of a top-antitop quark pair. Technicolor theories exclude the action of this particle. Spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking leads to a non-zero vacuum expectation value in this particle’s mechanism. This particle is [*] thought to have a mass around 140 GeV and spin 0. This particle explains why W and Z bosons have mass, but photons do not. Sought by the Large Hadron Collider, for 10 points, name this so-called “God particle,” an undiscovered boson of the Standard Model thought to provide mass to other particles.<br>ANSWER: <u>Higgs</u> boson<br><br>
