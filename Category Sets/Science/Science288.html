Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>One benefit to using this value to describe a system is the ability to use any generalized set of coordinates. If this value is originally invariant under symmetry, then the resulting equations will be as well, which is useful when testing to see if a physical model is consistent with special and general relativity. When this value fails to be applicable, such as when observing a dissipative system, then conserved quantities do not necessarily correspond to any particular symmetries. Equations of motion can be derived from this value if the initial and end states of a system are known through the use of the Hamiltonian principle.

If Bernoulli’s principle is expressed with all the terms in distance squared per time squared, this quantity is divided by density, and an increase in this quantity has the same type of impact as an increase in energy.
