Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>For any integer N, the sum of all numbers having this property from 1 to N must be a perfect square.  It has been proven that for all numbers less than ten to the three hundredth power, there are no perfect numbers with this property. The tangent and sine functions both have this property, which applies to any function for which f of x plus f of negative x equals zero, and is therefore symmetric about the origin.
