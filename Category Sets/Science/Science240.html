An extension of this movement to two dimensions traces out a Bowdith curve, which is also known as a Lissajous [lis-ah-zhoo] figure. This occurs when objects have an acceleration that varies inversely with the opposite of position. One commonly given example of it is only an estimation based on a small-angle approximation, which assumes that the sine of theta is approximately theta.
