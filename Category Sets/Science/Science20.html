1. Science/All (SCOP 3 2012)<br><strong>The magnetosphere of this planet is comparatively weak, as shown by Pioneer 11 and   Voyager 2 flybys. This planet’s largest moon was landed on by the  Huygens [HOY -gens] probe. This is the least </strong> dense planet in the solar system, with a density  of less than 1 gram per cubic centimeter.

Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>Problems with this organ are sometimes detected using the psoas [SOH uhs] or obdurator sign. Problems arise when the lumen of this organ is obstructed, which is usually caused by lymphoid hyper- plasia. Its base is found at McBurney's point and connected to the cecum [SEE cuhm]. When there are problems with it, patients typically resist motion and report pain in the abdominal right lower quadrant. Name this organ known to ancient Egyptians as the worm of the intestine, often removed because it is un- necessary.<br>ANSWER: vermiform <u>appendix</u><br><br>3. Science/Physics (BISB 2013)<br>During the invention of this device, the so-called "traitorous eight" founded Fairchild. John Pierce coined the name of this invention, which began as strips of gold attached to a plastic triangle called the "point-contact" type. This device, which replaced Lee De Forest's triode tube, was easier to manufacture in the "bipolar junction" form than the "field effect" form. Every 18 months, the number of these which can fit on an IC doubles, according to Moore's Law. Bell Labs scientists Brattain, Bardeen, and Shockley won the 1956 Nobel for inventing this device. For 10 points, name these semiconductor-containing devices used as amplifiers and switches.<br>ANSWER: transistors<br><br>4. Science/Biology (BHSAT 2013)<br>In adults, these cells are created in the subventricular zone, which is bounded by the ependyma. When Substance P is released by these cells in response to nociceptive stimuli, inflammation occurs. Schwann cells coat parts of these cells in an insulating sheath, the loss of which can lead to multiple sclerosis. They form a primitive "net" in cnidarians, but form a more complex system that includes somatic and autonomic branches in chordates. Astrocytes, a type of glial cell, help regulate the plasticity of the synapses between these cells. For 10 points, name these cells whose dendrites receive signals from axons.<br>ANSWER: neurons [or nerve cells]<br><br>5. Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2004)<br>This property is indirectly a measure of the immediate dislocation creation energy, since it is best defined as a material’s localized resistance to plastic deformation. This material property may be rigorously defined in terms of the results of swing tests or impact tests, which give rise to the Brinnell, Knoop, and Rockwell scales of it. For ten points, name the property that is probably more familiar in the naive form of scratch tests, which define the Mohs scale of it.<br>ANSWER: <u>hardness</u><br><br>6. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>This statement can be proven using Markov’s inequality, and it can be used to prove the weak law of large numbers and Kolmogorov’s inequality. Markov’s inequality states that the probability of a positive random variable exceeding a given value is less than or equal to the expected value of the random variable divided by the given value, and Kolmogorov’s inequality limits the sum of random variables. One consequence of this theorem is that the difference between the mean and median of a set of numbers is less than the standard deviation. Name this statement that the probability that the distance from a number in a distribution to the expected value is greater than k standard deviations is always less than or equal to one over k squared.<br>ANSWER: Chebyshev’s inequality [or Chebyshev’s theorem]<br><br>7. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This term describes a polynomial such that the sum of each term has the same total degree and describes a catalyst that is in the same phase as the reactants.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>Kiliani-Fischer synthesis can be used to form this compound, along with mannose, through the reaction of arabinose with hydrogen cyanide, followed by cyanohydrin hydrolysis and reduction. Reduction of this compound by two electrons yields the widespread artificial sweetener sorbitol. Emil Fischer won the Nobel Prize in 1902  partly for discovering a projection that accurately demonstrated the chirality of carbon atoms in this aldose.

Most of the material in its magnetosphere is supplied by ionized sulfur dioxide gas. That gas is produced by volcanic activity on one of its moons. The Voyager space probes documented the volcanic activity on that moon, Io, which is one of the four Galilean satellites. This gas giant is host to a centuries-long reddish storm, the Great Red Spot.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>A model of this process in multicomponent systems that permits its namesake coefficients to be negative was developed independently by Maxwell and Stefan. An ensemble of photons can be modeled with equations for this process in materials with high optical depth and low mean free path.

Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XV 2007)<br>|  The presence of cro protein in a cell prevents this process. Phage β [BAY-tuh] can insert the gene for the diphtheria toxin during this process via the namesake conversion, which can also result in an increase in the imperviousness of the host cell’s external membrane. Induction, often involving UV radiation, ends this process to begin its counterpart. In this process, the viral DNA is mixed with host DNA, where it remains dormant for a time.

Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>One of these substances consists of palladium deposited on CaCO3 reacted with lead acetate and is used to hydrogenate alkynes into alkenes, called the Lindlar variety. Another of these substances is usually titanium and is used in alkene synthesis, called the Ziegler-Natta type. Iron oxide acts as one of these in the Haber process and these substances act by [*] providing an alternate pathway to a reaction, thereby lowering the energy of the transition state.

Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>This man names a model of a solid which says each atom is a quantum harmonic oscillator. This scientist proposed the “Hole Argument” to help explain one of his theories. One of his papers argues that organisms moving at the speed of light would not age as compared to those who remained, which inspired the twin paradox. Among his “Annus Mirabilis” papers of 1905 are his explanation of a stochastic model of Brownian motion. This man’s Nobel Prize came for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.

Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>One example of this statement is the kidney removing bicarbonate ions from the blood to generate hydrogen ions and raise the blood’s pH. In physics, Lenz’s law is an analogue of this statement, which does not apply for the addition of an inert gas. Another example of it is lowering the temperature during the Haber process since the Haber process gives off about 90 kilojoules per mole and is therefore exothermic. For 10 points, name this principle which states that a system in chemical equilibrium will shift to counteract an imposed stress.<br>ANSWER: <u>LeChatelier’s</u> principle<br><br>16. Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>This is often said to be a language that "makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot." There are many versions of it, but the most recent is the 99 implementation. It stemmed from a stripped-down version of BCPL and was developed for a PDP-11 machine. Known as a weakly-typed language, it lacks support for generic programming and exception handling. Thus, object-oriented practices are very difficult to implement in this language. However, people still consider it to be fast, efficient, and versatile due to its low-level capabilities, though it still has many security vulnerabilities, most notably its lack of bound-checking for arrays. FTP, name this programming language that was developed for UNIX and has influenced the development of most modern programming languages.<br>ANSWER: <u>C</u> (Do NOT accept C++, C#, etc.)<br><br>17. Science/All (Bulldog High School Academic Tournament (BHSAT) 2008)<br>This is based on the binomial theorem and shows up on de Finetti diagrams as a parabola. It corrected the “genophagy” theory that thought recessive traits would slowly disappear over time. Small population sizes disrupt this because they cause random changes in the gene pool, while random mating is necessary to maintain it. FTP, identify this genetic principle, defined by the equation p2+2pq+q2, which can be used to find frequencies of alleles in populations, the named for a mathematician and a physician.<br>ANSWER: <u>Hardy-Weinberg</u> equilibrium (or <u>Hardy-Weinberg</u> principle)<br><br>18.
