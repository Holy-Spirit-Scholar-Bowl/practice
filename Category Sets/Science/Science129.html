1. Science/All (Bulldog High School Academic Tournament (BHSAT) 2008)<br>Pencil and paper ready. Give your answer as a fraction in lowest terms. John and Mary play a game with a spinner that is painted one-third red. They take turns and if the spinner lands on red, the player who spun the spinner wins. If Mary spins first, what is John’s chance of winning? It may help to realize that Mary has a one-third chance of winning on the first spin, and that John has two-thirds of Mary’s chance of winning at each stage of the game, and thus has two-thirds of Mary’s chance to win the game.<br>ANSWER: <u>2/5</u><br><br>2.
