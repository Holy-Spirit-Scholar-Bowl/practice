1. Science/All (BDAT I 2011)<br><strong>Since the Bohr model gives an exact radius for an electron, it violates the description of this statement. A paper that its developer published describes this statement with a gamma-ray microscope and the collision of a photon and electron. Able to be derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it is vital to the </strong> Copenhagen interpretation. Another inequality that describes this statement divides Plank’s constant by two. For 10 points, name this statement from quantum mechanics that says it is impossible to know both the momentum and position of a particle at the same time.<br>ANSWER: <u>Heisenberg uncertainty</u> principle [MB]<br><br>2. Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>Rubin found anomalous rotation curves in spiral galaxies that implied the existence of this that caused velocity to stay constant with radius. The WMAP experiment excluded the warm type of this, and Zwicky postulated the existence of halos of this material. Baryonic forms were not found in enough abundance in astronomical surveys, leading WIMPs to be considered the main component of this, and the existence of its cold type is part of the ΛCDM  model. This substance makes up 24% of the mass-energy of the universe. For 10 points, name this substance detected through its gravitational effects because it neither emits nor scatters electromagnetic radiation.<br>ANSWER: dark matter<br><br>3. Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>This trait is correlated with an increase in the bicondylar angle. This adaptation is enabled by the anterior positioning of the foramen magnum at the center of the skull’s base, and the shift away from an abducted hallux also facilitates it. The current accepted consensus is that large cranial capacity developed after this trait, facilitated by the three major spinal curves and earliest found in genera like Ardipithecus. Evidence for this trait in Australopithecus afarensis is provided by the Laetoli Footprints, and chimps use knuckle-walking instead of this trait.

Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Early craft in this program were designated Thor-Able and Atlas-Able. Other craft in this progam established a so- called “weather network” in space, which measured cosmic rays and the interplanetary magnetic field. The fourth probe in this program was the first vehicle to make a successful Earth-Moon trajectory, while the sixth probe was the first to analyze the Sun's corona and is still NASA's oldest functioning spacecraft. This program's namesake anomaly concerns the unexpected slowing of distant spacecraft, and its notable achievements include traversing the Asteroid Belt and proving that most gaps in Saturn's rings are not empty. Famous for carrying gold plaques intended to be viewed by extraterrestrials on its spacecraft 10 and 11, name this program that launched the first probes to photo- graph the outer solar system.<br>ANSWER: <u>Pioneer</u><br><br>8. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>Some tests of this include the Minnesota Multiphasic and California F-Scale. This was a central topic to Gordon Allport, who wrote about it in a book subtitled A psychological interpretation, and Abraham Maslow wrote about motivation and this. Rigid and unhealthy behaviors are classified as this type of disorder. Another test of this, based on Carl Jung’s [YOONG’Z] Psychological Types and using dichotomies such as sensing and intuition, is called Myers-Briggs. Specific cases can be classified as borderline, histrionic, or obsessive-compulsive, and hero-worship by a society focused on a leader is called a cult of this.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>This man adopted Hume’s experimental method to determine that “moral sense” was merely sympathy derived from mirroring the experience of others. He asserted that the Scots had an unhealthy constitution because they failed to eat potatoes.

He argued that the economic endeavors of the baker, brewer, and butcher are motivated not by benevolence but by self-interest.
