The two sides of the analogous structure in birds are connected by the pessulus. Three paired and three unpaired cartilages, nine in total, support this organ, including the ladle-shaped arytenoid and ring-shaped cricoid cartilages. This organ rises during swallowing, by raising one cartilage to close off the glottis. The acute form of its inflammation can result from a cold or prolonged shouting.

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>An empirically obtained version of it uses three substance-specific components and is called the Antoine equation. A general version of this relation does not assume a constant change in enthalpy or entropy over a temperature range, and it is derived by assuming no change in Gibbs free energy.

One class of these objects is classified as either spacelike, timelike, or null. One operation on one of these things is set equal to zero in Gauss's law for magnetism; that operation is called "divergence", or "del dot". A basis for these things is typically denoted "i hat, j hat, k hat" in rectangular coordinates.
