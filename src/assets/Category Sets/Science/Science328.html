This makes sense, considering other research in genetics which proved that extending them keeps cells alive for longer. Synthesized by a special class of reverse-transcriptases, they are usually 3 to 20 kilobases long and are typically cytosine and guanine rich.

Science/Computer Science (NTSS 2013)<br>This man declined an invitation to advise the Fifth Lateran Council on calendar reform, and his observation of an eclipse of Aldebaran helped him determine the diameter of the Moon. The seven assumptions of the model in this man's Little Commentary includes the belief in perfect, circular orbits, though the evidence gathered in his On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres was used by Galileo to promote a change in the way people viewed the solar system.

Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>This theory assumes the existence of Cladogenesis, but not anagenesis, and it rejects the idea of saltation. It was first said to have been introduced by Ernst Mayr's work, and it is based on allopatric speciation.

He originated the idea that life was carried between planets by spores, which is called panspermia. Inverse temperature can be found on the x-axis of one of his namesake plots. The Eyring-Polyani equation is closely related to an equation named for this man, which relates the rate constant of a reaction to a pre- exponential factor and activation energy.

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>The first one of these to be discovered was found in a triple star system. Sirius‟s companion, Sirius B, was the  next to be identified. Known to sometimes explode in Type Ia supernovas by carbon detonation, these stars are  believed to be the “corpses” of low mass stars which expand to red giants and undergo the triple-alpha process. The  “black” variation of this star has been proposed but the idea has since been discarded because even one of these  formed at the beginning of the universe would still radiate at temperatures of several thousand Kelvins.
