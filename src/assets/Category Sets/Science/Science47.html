1. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>Generation of oxygen through chemical reaction is known as “oxygen” this. The differential type of this in computer science attempts to optimize a solution by iteratively testing a candidate solution. The “stellar” type of this begins with the gravitational collapse of a giant molecular cloud into protostars, and, for the most massive stars, ends with a pair-instability supernova. Lamarck produced a theory of this, while the modern theory of this explains allele frequency changes through natural selection. Name this term, most often used to refer to the change in characteristics of species over generations, and associated with Darwin.<br>ANSWER: <u>evolution</u><br><br>2. Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>One special case of this process was ultimately responsible for the development of Martha’s Vineyard Sign Language during the 17th century. The Wright-Fisher model mathematically describes this effect. This effect is magnified during a rapid decrease in population called a population bottleneck, and a special case of it that occurs when a small group populates a new area is known as the *founder effect. It is most common for neutral genes; that is, they neither help nor hurt an organism. Unlike natural selection, this process is random. For 10 points, name this effect which sees the change in a gene’s frequency in a population.<br>ANSWER: genetic <u>drift</u> (accept <u>“founder</u> effect” before mentioned)<br><br>3. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>While Archimedes only identified three of them, Heron of Alexandria, as well as many of the scientists of the Renaissance, listed their number as five. In his work On Mechanics, Galileo became the first to realize that they do not actually create energy, they can only transform it. One of them can be constructed with a sheave and a rope, and several utilize the ability to </strong> convert torque into a linear force. Screws, wedges, wheel and axles, pulleys, levers, and inclined planes are all examples of, for 10 points, which non-complex devices that provide a mechanical advantage?<br>ANSWER: <u>simple machines</u><br><br>4. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>One theorem named for this man, generalized by Euler's totient theorem, states that for an integer a and a prime number p, a to the p power is congruent to a modulo p. Andrew Wiles proved another theorem named for this man, which states that there are no integers a, b, and c such that a to the x plus b to the x equals c to the x when x is an integer greater than two.

Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>These systems can be described by the Q factor, and, in one case, the quantity omega-sub-d is used to solve these systems. One type of these systems can be described by the equation T is equal to 2 times pi times the square root of m over k. These systems can be damped, and they experience a restoring force whose magnitude is proportional to their displacement from equilibrium, which is described by Hooke's law.

Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>The "overlap-extension" type of this process allows the construction of a certain sequence to extend past the longest primer, making it possible to produce polynucleotides from much smaller fragments. In this process, single- strand DNA segments are produced, enzymatic activity reforms the DNA, and various temperature changes allow the newly-formed DNA to remain in a stable conformation. For 10 points, name this biological technique of amplifying DNA, which consists of a denaturation and annealing step.<br>ANSWER: <u>polymerase chain reaction</u> (or <u>PCR</u>)<br><br>8. Science/All (SCOP Novice 2010)<br><strong>The velocity width and luminosity of these entities are compared by the Tully-Fisher relation. Irregular ones of these lie off the branches of the tuning fork diagram that separates these entities into two main subclasses, one of which can be "barred." Supermassive black holes are found at the center of many, if not all, of these systems, no matter if they are </strong> spiral or elliptical.

Science/Other (SCOP Novice 2014)<br><strong>A 2014 paper attempted to solve the firewall paradox surrounding these objects. They undergo evaporation when particle-antiparticle pairs are generated; that radiation is named for the author of A Brief History of Time and the aforementioned paper, which argues that these objects have </strong> apparent horizons, rather than event horizons.

Science/Biology (Maggie Walker GSAC 2012)<br>This process can occur in angiosperms through polyploidy during hybridization, and one consequence of it is cladogenesis. Eldredge and Gould theorized that it occurs in periodic bursts following periods of stasis. Changes in niches can cause the sympatric form of this process, which also exists in a peripatric type and was theorized to occur via "punctuated equilibrium." The founder effect and geographic isolation caused the Galapagos finches to undergo the allopatric type of this process.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>Each of these entities has a product divisible by 60, and primitive examples contain exactly one multiple of five. One method to generate them involves finding numbers whose product is half of a perfect square, and a method named for Euclid uses the difference of two squares and the sum of the same two squares. These sets always have an even sum, and their existence makes it necessary to include the requirement that n be greater than two in Fermat’s [fair-mah’z]  last theorem. In any one of these sets all three numbers must be integers, even though the equation they satisfy often gives an irrational third value when the first two are integers. Name these sets of integers that can be the side lengths of a right triangle.<br>ANSWER: Pythagorean triple(t)s<br><br>14. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>High compressibility of objects subject to this phenomenon leads to instability at equilibria. Flows driven by this force can be estimated with the Boussinesq approximation. The Cartesian Devil demonstrates this force, whose ratio to viscosity can be approximated with the Grashof number. This force regulates isostasy, and is responsible for convection. The earliest claim about this force was that an object in a fluid is lifted with force equal to the weight of displaced fluid, this being Archimedes’ principle. For 10 points, name this property that allows boats to float.<br>ANSWER: <u>buoyancy</u><br><br>15. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This principle's effects can be seen in a change in pressure through the use of a Cartesian devil. The value for this property is equal in a single system for all objects that have the same volume. This force has a value for a given object that is equal to total weight of all the fluid displaced by that object. That idea about this property is known as Archimedes' Principle.
