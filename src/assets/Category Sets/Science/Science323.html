One type of them peaks at an absolute magnitude of -19.3, which enables it to be used as a standard candle. While that type, 1a, results from the detonation of a white dwarf which exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit, the more common type results from the core collapse of a very massive star.

Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>This organ contains macrophages called Kupffer Cells, and it is also the primary site of gluconeogenesis. Prior to the bone marrow taking over, this organ creates red blood cells. Another function of this organ is the degradation of insulin, and it stores glycogen, along with secreting bile that is stored in the gallbladder.

Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XVI 2008)<br>|  A theoretical proof of this equation can be made by assuming that the molecules involved are point masses without volume which collide with each other while still conserving linear momentum and kinetic energy.  An alternative form of this equation involves substituting the product of Boltzmann’s constant and the actual number of molecules for the product of the number of moles and the universal gas constant.

Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2006)<br>This person was once denied reentry into the United States because, when asked “What do you think of  Karl Marx?” at customs, he replied “I have never met him, but no doubt he is a great man.” He lived  entirely out of the goodwill of his colleagues since he never had a home and carried all of his belongings  with him in a suitcase. In his own personal lingo, children were epsilons and God was the Supreme Fascist.  He was extremely prolific, in part because he frequently took amphetamines so he could put in seventeen-  hour days doing math. FTP, name this eccentric Hungarian mathematician.<br>ANSWER: Paul Erdıs<br><br>7. Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>Unfortunately, alpha sticking renders impractical the catalysis of this process by muons. Miley direct conversion may be used in the D-3He [dee helium three] type of this physical phenomenon because, with those reactants, it results in only charged particles.

It occurs along a feature called the primitive streak and sees cells undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition in order to migrate and proliferate. During it, the mammalian embryo loses radial symmetry and gains bilateral symmetry.

A Brook rearrangement uses these substances, such as a Grignard [grih-NARD] or organolithium [or-GA-noe-LIH-thee-um] reagent, as catalysts. These substances tend to hydrolyze triglycerides [trie-GLIH-suh-rides] in a process called saponification, which is why they often feel slippery, and these substances typically taste bitter.

At one point, this body was the subject of some confusion which led to the eventual discovery of the star 31 Crateris. A mission hoping to learn about its magnetic field is being launched by the European Space Agency and titled BepiColombo. Examination of this body have led to an unstable outer layer known as an “exosphere” and researchers using a VLA in 1991 found evidence to support the existence of thin ice caps.

Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>For anisotropic substances, this law can be represented using Voigt notation; it can be derived by defining deformation as adiabatic. Cauchy adapted this law to three-dimensional bodies; in three dimensions, a 4th order tensor with 81 coefficients must be applied for this law to hold; it is called the [*] stiffness tensor.
