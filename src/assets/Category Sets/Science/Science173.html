1. Science/All (Minnesota Novice Set 2011)<br>In its most general form, this statement is written as “standard deviation of A times standard deviation of B is greater than or equal to negative i over two times the commutator of A and B.” A thought experiment of observing an electron through a gamma-ray microscope justifies this statement that can measure the lifetime of a virtual particle. For 10 points, name this principle of quantum mechanics named for Heisenberg, that explains why position and momentum of a particle cannot be measured simultaneously.<br>ANSWER: Heisenberg <u>uncertainty</u> principle<br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>Lithotripsy is the method of choice for removing these objects, which contain small amounts of mucoprotein (MEW-ko-pro-teen). The largest of them are sometimes known as "staghorn" ones. About fifteen percent of them are composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate, but they are most commonly composed of calcium oxylate (OCKZ-uh-late) and calcium phosphate. They are most noticeable when they end up in the ureter, causing back and groin pain as they "pass." For 10 points, name these hard objects that form in an organ used to filter blood.<br>ANSWER: <u>kidney stones</u><br><br>3. Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2011)<br><strong>This quantity squared is equal to one kilogram times one meter divided by one Newton. This unit is equal to one farad times one ohm, and is the inverse of one Hertz. It is now conventionally defined in terms of vibrations of a </strong> cesium atom, as opposed to its original definition which pertained to the speed of light. The most common unit for velocity is meters divided by, for ten points, what most basic unit of time, 3600 of which are in an hour?<br>ANSWER: <u>Second</u> (prompt on <u>Time</u>)<br><br>4. Science/All (Maryland Spring 2012)<br>That the rotation curves of these objects does not decay as expected is strong evidence for the existence of dark matter. Lin and Shu hypothesized that certain structures in these objects were density waves. The center of these objects is often a supermassive black hole; if that black hole has an accretion disk these are said to have an active nucleus. These structures can be classified on Hubble's tuning fork as Irregular, Elliptical, or Spiral, while two nearby dwarf examples are called the Magellanic Clouds. For 10 points, name these large structures examples of which include Andromeda and the Milky Way.<br>ANSWER: <u>Galaxies</u> [accept "Spiral galaxies" until "Hubble's tuning fork"]<br><br>5. Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>One can use Kruskal coordinates to describe these objects when they fit the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, and they can be formed when an object surpasses the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit. Carter’s theorem states that only the Kerr-Newman metric is correct for describing a spinning charged one. Its temperature is inversely proportional to its mass and its entropy is proportional to its surface area. Laplace was one of the first people to conceive of the idea, but it was Schwarzschild who understood them in terms of relativity and John Wheeler who named them.

FTP, identify these browser extensions that were developed by Sun and allow Java programs to run in a self-contained browser.<br>ANSWER: Java Applets (Do not accept any variations on Applets besides Java)<br><br>8. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>This property of compounds is utilized in a form of chromatography developed by Shaltiel. That technique uses sepharose beads and "salting out." Examples of amino acids with this distinction include leucine, valine, and phenylalanine. This property is caused entropic driven interactions.

Science/All (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2012)<br><strong>C-waves do not enter this region, and the K in PKP denotes the part of the waves that travel through it. This is the innermost of two regions whose lower boundary is marked by a Lehmann discontinuity, and its upper bound is named after Gutenberg. Refraction of P-waves here causes a </strong> "shadow zone," and the S-waves cannot move through this region because they are transverse. The dynamo theory explains the geomagnetic field as a result of the rotation of this region. For ten points, identify this liquid region of the Earth found just below the mantle.<br>ANSWER: outer core (prompt on core)<br><br>10. Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>The XML-defined SVG file format notably does not encode one of these objects, and tweening and similar operations are easy in Flash because Flash does not use them. The Windows GDI provides a function that reflects the old slang for "blitting" these objects, and the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm provides lossless compression for these objects and is used in the gif file format. For 10 points, identify this common way to store an image, which, when uncompressed, associates a color value with each pixel and is sometimes abbreviated bmp.<br>ANSWER: bitmap<br><br>11. Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>Imperfect varieties of these entities have emissivities of less than one. One law governing the behavior of these objects performs poorly at long wavelengths, while another predicts infinite power at small wavelengths, leading to the ultraviolet catastrophe. Wien’s Law and the Rayleigh-Jeans law describing these objects were replaced by a law in which energy was [*] quantized. The energy radiated per unit surface area by one of these objects is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>The molecules selenorhodane (seh-leh-nor-HOH-dane) and thiocyanate (thai- oh-SAI-uh-nate) are sometimes called “pseudo-” members of this group, which exchanges one atom for another in the Finkelstein reaction. In the era of leaded gasoline, a compound made from ethylene (e-thuh-LEEN) and an element from this group was used to clean out engine cylinders. Another element from this group is in a solution which turns blue-black in the presence of starch, Lugol’s solution, and another element from this group gives mustard gas and DDT their deadly potency.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>Deoxygenated blood has a greater affinity for carbon dioxide, according to the Haldane effect, which is derived from this statement. The van 't Hoff equation calculates the effect of this statement for temperature. Long term elasticity is higher than short term elasticity, according to the application of it by economist Paul Samuelson. Raising the temperature in an exothermic system decreases the amount of the product, due to this, and the common-ion effect is a consequence of it.

Give the name of this type of quadrilateral that has two pairs of congruent adjacent sides.<br>ANSWER: kites<br><br>16. Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>This law will not be followed if the intermolecular bonding between two components of a solution is greater than the intermolecular bonding between the other combinations of components. For instance, a solution of benzene and ethyl alcohol will not obey this law because benzene and ethyl alcohol are immiscible. If a solution does not show preferential intermolecular bonding and thus obeys this law, it is considered an ideal solution. Those that deviate from it have an activity coefficient not equal to one. FTP, name this law which states that the vapor pressure of a solution is dependent on the vapor pressure of the components and their mole fraction.<br>ANSWER: Raoult's law<br><br>17.

Haplodiploidy may contribute to the development of eusociality under the inclusive theory of this concept which holds that it can be increased by altruism. It is measured by the selection coefficient, and genetic load is the percentage difference between the ideal and mean values of this quantity denoted w.
