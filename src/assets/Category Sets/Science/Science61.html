In some organisms, the end of this process may be described as rho dependent or independent; in the latter case, the hairpin loop forms and subsequently detaches. In those organisms, a structure named for Pribnow is analogous to the TATA box, and it begins when a holoenzyme forms from the binding of a sigma factor.
