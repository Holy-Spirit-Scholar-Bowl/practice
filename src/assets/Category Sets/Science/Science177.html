1. Science/Physics (BELLOCO 2014)<br>These particles are captured in the s-process of asymptotic giant branch stars. The namesake activation analysis of these particles determines the identity and quantity of elements in a sample. The beta decay of these spin one-half baryons results in the emission of a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. Nuclear power plants use these particles to bombard uranium-235 and induce a chain reaction. These particles consist of an up quark and two down quarks, and they were discovered by James Chadwick. The number of these particles in an atom determines its isotope. For 10 points, name these chargeless particles that are found together with protons in the nucleus.<br>ANSWER: neutrons<br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Districts 2011)<br>Like barbiturates, this compound binds to GABA-A receptors in the body. One method for detecting this compound is by mixing it with chromic acid to produce chromium (III) and acetic acid. Fractional distillation can purify this compound up to about 95%, with a desiccator required for higher purity. Corn and sugar cane are popular sources of this compound when used as a biofuel. Its concentration is often measured in "proof."

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>One version of this model, in which objects are pushed to regions of heated low-density aether, was used by John Herapath to mechanically explain gravitation. This theory predicts a value of 2mv for momentum gained by the wall of a container due to a single particle, because this theory assumes that all collisions are perfectly elastic. It also postulates that individual particles have negligible volumes and that intermolecular attractive or repulsive forces between gas particles are also negligible. For 10 points, name this theory that describes the behavior of ideal gases undergoing constant, random motion.<br>ANSWER: <u>kinetic theory</u> of gases [or <u>kinetic-molecular</u> theory]<br><br>4. Science/All (MSU/UD Housewrite 2012)<br><strong>This man discovered a method for minimizing chromatic aberration in telescopes, and solved the brachistochrone problem with the curve of a cycloid. This man’s model of the Luminiferous Aether explained refraction and diffraction. This man is credited with the discovery of the</strong> generalized binomial theorem and he devised a method for accurately approximating the roots of functions. The first of this man’s three laws of motion states that a body in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by a force.

Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>Antimony pentafluoride is a part of the magic one. The Hammett function measures the strength of these. The log of their disassociation constant plus the log of the reduced form over the original makes up the right side of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. According to Lewis these are electron pair acceptors, while according to Brønsted, these are proton donors. For 10 points, name these chemicals such as HCL that lower the pH of a solution.<br>ANSWER: <u>acids</u><br><br>6. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 16 2011)<br><strong>These objects are often described mathematically in Hessian normal form. The angle between the intersection of two of them is the dihedral angle. If one of these objects contains the point r|0| and a normal vector n, it can be defined as the set of points r such that the dot product between n and a vector from r to the origin is equal to the zero vector. The different conic sections can be obtained by intersecting one or two </strong> cones with one of these objects and they can be defined by using a minimum of three points. For 10 points, name this flat surface which is the two dimensional analogue of a line.<br>ANSWER: <u>plane</u><br><br>7. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>These geologic structures can be distinguished from similar phenomena because they lack a central canal, and cal- cite pearls often grow under conditions that do not support the formation of these structures. Rare basalt examples of these structures fill a chamber in Iceland's Arnahellir lava tube, while the ice-type is common in mines where tempera- tures are markedly higher at the ceiling than the floor. Most of these structures occur in karst topology, like the Hall of Giants and Witch's Finger in Carlsbad Caverns, and they are the only dripstone formations that cannot collapse under their own weight. Name these structures that grow from the dripping of calcium carbonate-rich water onto the floor of a limestone cave, sometimes forming the bottom half of a column with a neighboring stalactite.<br>ANSWER: stalagmite<br><br>8. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 17 2011)<br><strong>In 1961, Claus Jönsson (CLOWS YUHN-sun) reproduced the set up of this experiment with electrons. The set up for this experiment when using only one particle gives the same results as the original, except when a detector is used. That detector being used causes a pair of </strong> bands to be formed instead of the usual pattern caused by interference. For 10 points, name this experiment first carried out by Thomas Young sending light through a pair of openings, which showed light has a wave nature.<br>ANSWER: Young's <u>double slit</u> experiment [or <u>Young's</u> experiment before it is read]<br><br>9. Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2010)<br>The Fitzgerald-Lorentz hypothesis was falsified, and the Sagnac Effect was discovered in two experiments that built upon this experiment. The main apparatus was placed on a large marble block that was then floated in a pool of mercury. This experiment began when a single source of white light was sent out through a half-silvered mirror that was used to split the light into two beams travelling at right angles to one another. Conducted at what is now Case Western Reserve University was, for 10 points, what doubly-eponymous experiment that disproved the idea of luminiferous ether?<br>ANSWER: Michelson-Morley Experiment<br><br>10. Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>Hicksian demand can be recovered with the Slutsky equation if Marshallian demand and this phenomenon are both known. As wages increase, this phenomenon will start to predominate, causing the backward-bending labor supply curve. This phenomenon can be visualized by plotting a budget line parallel to the original on indifference curves. It is positive for </strong> normal goods and negative for inferior ones. It is theoretically possible for this effect to predominate when a good's price drops, leading to less of that good being consumed. A Giffen good is a good where this is larger than the substitution effect. For 10 points, name this effect a change in a consumer's total real wealth has on behavior.<br>ANSWER: <u>income effect</u> [or wealth effect until \"wealth\" is read]<br><br>11. Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>This function can be estimated for large values using Stirling's approximation. One can compute this function for any element in its domain by adding one and applying the gamma function. Used three times in the formula for calculating binomial [*] coefficients, this function is found in the denominator of each term in a general Taylor series.

Science/All (WUHSAC IX 2007)<br>The structural varieties of these can have drastically different effects. For example, theobromine is a caffeine analog found in chocolate, while dimethylxanthine [die-meth-ill-zan-theen] is a bronchodilator used in the treatment of respiratory disease. The enantiomeric varieties however, will always have identical physical properties except for the direction in which the two molecules rotate polarized light.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>Cells in these organisms contain special vesicles known as physodes [FY-so-deez]. They include the order Desmarestia, which dominates subtidal zones of the Antarctic region, the Ectocarpales, which contain heterotrichous thalli, and the Fucales, which reproduces in a manner similar to that of land plants. Another species is anchored by holdfasts and can grow to 100 meters. Also known as Phaeophyceae [fay-oh-FY-see-eh], they gain their color from the presence of fucoxanthin.

Erin wants to find the volume inside a particular surface of revolution. The mathematical shape Gabriel’s horn is created by rotating the function 1/x about the x-axis to create a long, tapered trumpet- like shape. Its volume along the interval from x=1 to x=a is given by the integral of the product pi and the square of the function, which gives the equation V= pi(1-1/a). [“pi times the quantity one minus one over a”] If the horn is infinitely long, that is, if we allow a to approach infinity, what value will the horn’s volume approach?

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>Gerhard Gentzen showed that for each of these entities that uses the cut rule there is another one that does not use the cut rule. One form of these entities is classified as “by construction”, which generally is a subset of the existence type of these, which can be contrasted with the uniqueness type. Another existence type of this entity, which is used for limits, is the delta- epsilon type. A common type of this entity starts by establishing that a statement is true for a particular value and then establishing that whenever the statement is true for one value, then it is true for the next value, which is known as induction. These statements often end with the phrase “quod erat demonstrandum”, and to organize these entities, some students use two columns labeled Statements and Reasons, respectively. Name these entities which use deductive logic to show that their conclusions are true.<br>ANSWER: proofs<br><br>18. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regionals 2011)<br>One type of this field, arising from a problem proposed by Johann Bernoulli (ber-NOO-lee), is the one "of variations." This field solves Zeno's dichotomy paradox by showing that the distances traveled are equivalent to a convergent series, as an infinite number of those distances can be summed to equal a non-infinite number by use of the integral. That function, along with the derivative, is in the realm of, for 10 points, what branch of mathematics invented independently by Newton and Leibniz (LIBE-nitz)?<br>ANSWER: <u>calculus</u><br><br>19. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>Massive O and B stars may produce bubbles named after this phenomenon, filling huge cavities in the interstellar medium. Radiation pressure on condensing dust may cause this phenomenon in stars near the end of their lives. Wolf-Rayet stars have very strong ones of these, which causes them to lose relatively large amounts of their mass.
