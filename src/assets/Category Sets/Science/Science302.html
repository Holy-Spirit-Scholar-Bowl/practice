Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>This mathematician gives his name to a type of surface which is intersected exactly once by every non-spacelike curve. One theory named for him states that three-dimensional convex polytopes with congruent corresponding faces must be congruent to each other. Like Lagrange, he gives his name to a form of the remainder in the statement of </strong> Taylor’s theorem. He names a weaker condition equivalent to convergence for a real sequence but weaker for the complex numbers.

Perturbation theory was applied to the effect of one of these to predict the orbits of the planets, while one class of them only allows for the inter-conversion of energy between its kinetic and  potential forms.
