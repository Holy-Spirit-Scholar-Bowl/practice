Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>The theorem that every positive integer is the sum of at most n n-gonal numbers is called this man's “polygonal number theorem”. The set of numbers named for him contains integers of the form 2, to the 2, to the nth power, plus one. Another of his theorems states that given any prime p and integer a, a to the pth power is equal to a mod p. In optics, he gives his name to the principle of least time.

Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>The initial part of this phase involves the accumulation of growth factors, cyclin-dependent kinases, and S-promoting factor. This process is characterized by successive activity of DNA helicase and polymerase, resulting in the formation of successful copies of the genome in a "semiconservative" process.

Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>Many proteins that control the rate of this process contain zinc finger domains. In some organisms, a structure named for Pribnow is the site of this process, which in prokaryotes begins when a holoenzyme forms from the binding of a sigma factor. In eukaryotes, its initiation is greatly aided by the acetylation of histones and often occurs at the TATA box. This process is followed by a step in which lariats form and introns are spliced out after polymerase has bound to and run along the template strand.

In response to John Needham's attempt to prove this, Lazzaro Spallanzani performed an experiment involving a sealed container partially evacuated of air, in which he boiled soup. Despite its obvious flaws demonstrated by Francesco Redi, this theory persisted well into the 19th century because Darwinism suggested that life evolved from chemical substances.
