His law was proposed soon after Gay-Lussac's Law, allowing scientists to use volume measurements to find chemical formulas. This person's law was an early step towards the Ideal Gas Law, but it assumed constant pressure and volume.

A statement of this man is often proven by considering that the wavefunction for some particles must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of some variables. The pressure that opposes gravitational collapse in white dwarfs is due to that statement. This scientist proposed that the energy, momentum, and spin of </strong> beta decay could be conserved by the introduction of an additional particle: the neutrino.

Numbers like 561 and 1105 give false positives for his namesake primality test; those numbers are Carmichael numbers. That test is based on this man’s theorem that a to the power of p is congruent to a modulo p.
