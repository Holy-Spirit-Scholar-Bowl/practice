1. Science/Physics (PACE NSC 2015)<br><strong>A material demonstrating this phenomenon appears to decrease in weight in a Gouy balance. An electron in 2D orbit around a nucleus demonstrates this phenomenon due to Larmor precession, with a magnitude proportional to the radius squared over six times the mass. This phenomenon explains the strong downfield shift of aromatic compounds' ring currents in proton NMR. A normal conductor cooled into superconducting state displays the </strong> perfect form of this phenomenon, with a susceptibility of negative one. This phenomenon occurs if all electrons in a material are paired. This behavior could be used to accomplish levitation because it causes materials to repel all B fields.
