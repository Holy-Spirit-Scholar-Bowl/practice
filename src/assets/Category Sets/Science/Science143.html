1. Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XIX 2011)<br>This substance's ability to form metal ligands is exemplified in the coordination complex it forms with copper and water, Schweitzer's reagent. This substance is bubbled into a solution of sodium chloride in one implementation of the Solvay process, and is converted to nitric acid in the Ostwald process. One process that produces it uses an iron catalyst at high temperature. That process, known as the Haber-Bosch process, is used to create this chemical commonly used in fertilizers.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>When applied as a unary operator in Python, this character can expand a list object into the arguments of a function call. In Fortran, two consecutive ones signify exponentiation. In Perl, it is used to refer to the typeglob of all variables with a given name, and the absence of one before a typeglob signifies that it is a bareword. In C, it can be used as the inverse of the ampersand to obtain the contents of a pointer. For 10 points, UNIX and MS-DOS use what character as a wildcard character in searching, also seen in both C and Java to represent multiplication?<br>ANSWER: <u>asterisk</u> [accept <u>star</u>]<br><br>3. Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>This organelle is isolated using NP-40 detergent, crushed, then imaged via autoradiography in its namesake run-on assay. Mutations in proteins found in this organelle are responsible for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria. The Ran GTPase is used for transport into and out of this organelle, which occurs through pore complexes. This organelle contains both </strong> speckles and coiled bodies. This structure uses intermediate filaments called lamins to support the inner surface of its double membrane. This organelle also contains a structure responsible for ribosome production, and is darkly staining because it contains chromatin.

Science/All (Brookwood Invitational Scholars Bowl 2013)<br>Material found in “Dodo” and “Goldilocks” confirmed the existence of this substance, which is suggested by prominent “blue berries.” This substance was proposed as the reason that chunks of bright material disappeared from Phoenix’s arm. A mistranslation of Giovanni Schiaparelli convinced 19th century scientists that canali actually contained this. Rifts in the Valles Marineris may have been created by this substance, which Opportunity found near Endeavor Crater.

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 2 2008)<br>In plants, it serves as a micronutrient, influences calcium ion utilization, and allows root tips to elongate. This element's ability to absorb neutrons led it to be used in the control rods of nuclear reactors. Involved in a common anti-Markovnikov reaction, this element is commonly found in banana bonds and is a notable exception to the octet rule.

Science/All (QuAC I 2008)<br>The Yukawa interaction is used to describe this as mediated by pions, while its Langrangian predicts that its carriers are subject to it, leading to asymptotic freedom. That phenomenon can be predicted by an SU3 gauge theory, quantum chromodynamics, and this interaction, unlike its counterpart, is mediated by gluons.

Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>The Hausdorff dimensions of these objects are greater than their topological dimensions. Examples of these objects include the Menger sponge and the Sierpinski triangle, and types of them, such as the Cantor set, can be created by infinitely iterating a recursive equation. These objects exhibit self-similarity on very small scales, and resemble natural features like coastline and snowflakes. For 10 points, identify these geometric spaces named by Benoît Mandelbrot, which contain infinitely smaller copies of themselves.<br>ANSWER: fractals<br><br>8. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>In 1946, Bernard Lovell used one of the first radio telescopes to determine the size of one of these events, whose most atypical example is linked to the break up of 3200 Phaethon. One of these events named for St. Cyril was unique because it had no radiant, while the two best known ones were caused by objects called Tempel-Tuttle and Swift- Tuttle. The magnitude of these events can be assessed in terms of zenithal hourly rate, and many of these events pro- duce clouds of ionized silicon and magnesium in the upper atmosphere. Caused by the Earth passing through the de- bris stream of a comet, and including the Leonid in November and Perseid in August, identify these events in which many rocks enter the atmosphere at the same time, creating numerous bright streaks across the night sky.<br>ANSWER: <u>meteor shower</u><br><br>9. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>The Huronian one may have been triggered by the oxygen castrastrophe. The Driftless zone was relatively unaffected the last time one of these occurred.

Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>Kepler’s Conjecture postulates that these objects can be packed with a density of approximately 74%. The Banach-Tarski paradox states that a solid one of these objects can be cut into finitely many pieces and re-assembled into two copies of the same size as the original. For a  non-Euclidean geometry occurring on these objects, triangles have angle sum greater than 180 degrees. </strong> Archimedes derived the formula for the volume of this figure by noting that it occupied two-thirds of the volume of its circumscribed cylinder.

Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>The lowermost portion of this region has maintained its name from Keith Bullen's nomenclature; it is known as D double prime and is the likely source of the Gutenberg discontinuity.   Some of its notable features are formed by heat rising in diapirs and may create flood basalts, and the Morgan type of them is strongly influenced by a liquid layer beneath this. Its upper portions are rich in olivine and comprise the asthenosphere.

Science/All (NTV 2008)<br>The resolution of the paradox associated with this law invokes Le Chatelier's [lih SHAHT uh lee airz] Principle to Lorentz forces on electrons; that paradox concerns a disk generator spinning against a brush. Homopolar generators and, in fact, all generators and motors make use of the consequences of this law. The negative sign indicates that it incorporates Lenz's Law, and Joseph Henry discovered it inde- pendently from its namesake. Identify this law of electrodynamics, one of Maxwell's equations, that can be written as the curl of the electric field equals negative the partial derivative of the magnetic B-field with respect to time, or as the induced electromotive force equals negative the change in magnetic flux with respect to time, and explains how a current is produced in a loop of wire turning in a magnetic field.<br>ANSWER: <u>Faraday's</u> Law of Induction or the <u>Maxwell</u>-<u>Faraday</u> Law of Induction<br><br>13. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>Tylosis involves resinous chemicals blocking this tissue type to slow infection. Minerals entering this   tissue must first cross the endodermal Casparian strip, and this tissue has secondary wall thickenings  that can be annular, helical, reticulate, scalariform, or pitted.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>Any natural number can be written uniquely as a sum of nonconsecutive ones of these numbers by Zeckendorf’s theorem. The worst-case runtime of the Euclidean algorithm is for a consecutive pair of these. Three of these numbers cannot form a Pythagorean triplet, and neither can the similar Lucas numbers. The ratio of each number to the previous one in this sequence approaches one plus the square root of five over two, or the golden ratio.

For triangles whose sides are Pythagorean triples, the radius of this circle is a whole number. Its center can be found by taking the weighted average of vertices of the generating triangle using opposite side lengths as weights, and it splits the triangle sides into lengths equal to the factors in Heron’s Formula.
