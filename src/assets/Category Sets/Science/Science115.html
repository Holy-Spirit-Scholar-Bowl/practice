Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>Diabetes mellitus and goiter are common in patients with this condition, which is often treated with the drug Restandol. While symptoms of marked mental retardation and fusion of certain bones vary, in most cases, it results in delayed motor function, speech, and maturation.

Science/Computer Science (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Matrix multiplication algorithms that are "oblivious" to this entity are usually stored in row-major order. The MESI protocol is a write-back scheme used to maintain coherence in this component. The problem with "direct-mapped" schemes for maintaining this component is that data may be overridden in it even if it is not completely full. Like paging schemes, this component may make use of the LRU algorithm to decide which data to </strong> store. Multi-level schemes use L1, L2, and L3 types of this component, which exploits the temporal and locality principles to avoid accessing RAM.

Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>This process sees the deactivation of the maturation promoting factor. During this process, CDC20 activates the APC complex, resulting in the end of securin proteins inhibiting separin proteins. Separin protein then goes on to hydrolyze cohesion proteins. A lag that can occur during this process causes monosomy, seen in patients with Turner’s syndrome.
