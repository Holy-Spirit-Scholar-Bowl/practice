Science/Physics (BISB 2013)<br>Note to moderator: Read this question slowly, as the pronouns are a little bit dicey and the teams will likely get confused. The Lense-Thirring effect causes these things to "drag". Euler forces result when these things rotate non-uniformly. Einstein's equivalence principle states that gravity and acceleration depend only on these things. Galilean transformations convert between these things, as do "boosts" involving the Lorentz factor, when these are moving close to the speed of light. According to special relativity, none of these is absolute. Fictitious forces arise when these are accelerating; for example, a rotating one is responsible for the observed deflection of objects in the Coriolis effect.
