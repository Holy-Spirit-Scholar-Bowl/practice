1. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Animals in this class have bodies that consist of a prosoma and opisthosoma (oh-PISS-thoh-soh-muh), and the largest of them that ever lived were aquatic species called eurypterids (yoo-RIHP-tuh-ridz). Orders within this class are distinguished by the shape and function of the pedipalps, and some members of this class take in oxygen through soft overlapping flaps inside the abdominal cavity known as book lungs. Apulmonate members of this class include the Acari, which consists of mites and ticks. The species Androctonus in this class can kill humans with a neurotoxin; that species is better known as the fat-tailed scorpion. More famous for the ability of some of its members to spin silk, name this class that includes harvestmen and spiders.<br>ANSWER: <u>Arachnida</u> [or <u>Arachnids</u>]<br><br>2. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>An example of this class was discovered in China in 1993 and classified as the genus Confuciusornis [kun-FYOO-shus-OR-niss], while an early example in the Americas was the Phorusrhacos [for-us-RAH-kos], which is similar to but larger than modern-day seriemas [sair-ee-AY-mahz]. Jacques Gauthier [goh-tee- ay] claims that this class of animals descended from theropods. These vertebrates have a synsacrum [sin-SAAK-rum] instead of a pelvis, and their constant-volume lungs are supplemented by anterior and posterior air sacs. The earliest known example is the Archaeopteryx [ar-kee-AHP-tur-iks], which like modern examples contained a furcula, or wishbone.

Science/All (DAFT 2009)<br>When these organisms reproduce, they form a thin structure called the protonema. These organisms can be divided into two groups, one of which contains the antheridia and archegonia on the same body and are referred to as monoicous. Throughout most of their life cycle these organisms exist as a haploid gametophyte while during reproduction, the sporangium is encased in a stalk called a seta. This group, which includes genus Marchantia, contrasts with tracheophytes in their lack of xylem and phloem.
