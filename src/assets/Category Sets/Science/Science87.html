Science/Physics (BELLOCO 2014)<br>An echocardiogram uses this phenomenon to determine the velocity of blood, and the Mössbauer rotor experiments measured one form of this phenomenon through the emission of gamma rays. One experiment used canal ray tubes to measure the transverse form of this phenomenon, and Lorentz transformations are used when calculating this effect's relativistic form.

Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q 1 2008)<br>Rotating ones have limited ranges of velocity, which is a function of the distance from the vortex. It was originally proposed that all condensates of bosonic particles at ground states are these.

Science/Biology (LIST 2014)<br><strong>In humans, the environment in which these cells must develop is carefully regulated by the cremaster muscle, and Sertoli cells provide nutrients to these cells before they mature. In some plants, these cells are produced by the antheridia. These cells cause a release of calcium ions that prompts cortical granules to fuse with the perivitelline space, and contain a vesicle called an </strong> acrosome that allows them to degrade part of the zona pellucida. In humans they travel through the vas deferens after maturing in the epididymis under the cooler temperatures provided by the scrotum.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>The discontinuous behavior of this quantity when two substances are mixed is the subject of the Gibbs paradox. Boltzmann rigorously defined this quantity for a system as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates corresponding to an observed macrostate. The Sackur-Tetrode equation, derived from that definition, allows for this quantity to be calculated for an ideal monatomic gas. In differential form it appears in the definition of Gibbs free energy; its product with absolute temperature is subtracted from enthalpy to correct for energy in the system unavailable to do work. Therefore it is often thought of as the amount of disorder in a system.

Augustin Cauchy would extend this law to three dimensions using a compliance matrix. In isotropic form, it can be written generally using Poisson's ratio, or alternatively using Young's modulus and the bulk modulus.
