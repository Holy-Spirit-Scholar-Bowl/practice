1. Science/Chemistry (New Trier Scobol Solo 2014)<br>Adding one of these groups to homocysteine [HOH-moh-SISS-teen] results in methionine [meh-"THIGH"-uh-nin]. The enzyme MutH ["mute-H"] specifically targets regions without the presence of this modification, and the enzyme Dam performs this modification on GATC sites. The formation of tightly packed and transcriptionally inactive hetero·chromatin is associated with adding two or three of this group to the lysine at the ninth position on histone ["HISS-tone"] H3. Barr bodies have large amounts of this modification. In bacteria, this group prevents restriction enzymes from digesting their hosts' DNA.

Science/All (Delta Burke 2003)<br>It has a period of about six days and acts as an obstacle to oncoming gas which it deflects to the north or south. To the north of it winds blow westward relative to it while to the south winds blow to the east. It varies in size; sometimes it is smaller than the earth and sometimes three times larger. Continually observed for nearly 400 years, it rotates counterclockwise like other southern high pressure regions and many scientists believe that sulfur and phosphorous compounds are the cause of its distinctive color.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2008)<br>The one named for Crabtree is a significant improvement over one named for Wilkinson. Some of these are usually “poisoned” with lead compounds, and are usually deposited onto surfaces such as carbon or calcium carbonate, while another kind is made from titanium-aluminum complexes of organic compounds and is used in polymerization of 1-alkenes.
