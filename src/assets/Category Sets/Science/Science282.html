Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>Recombinant deoxyribonuclease (dee-AHK-see-rai-boh-NOO-klee-ays) is one treatment for this disorder, whose gene gives carriers some resistance to cholera (KAH-lur-ah) and codes for a protein missing one phenylalanine (fen-l -AL-uh-neen). Males with this disorder may be sterile due to congenital absence of the vas deferens, and Pseudomonas is the most common cause of infection in adults with it. The name of this disease comes from the scarring observed in the pancreas, and the inability of chloride ions to cross cell membranes results in abnormally high salt excretion, which allows this disease to be diagnosed by a sweat test.
