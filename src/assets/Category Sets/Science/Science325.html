Episodes of this cyclic event are indicated by increases of more than half a degree centigrade in sea surface temperature and series of Kelvin waves. It typically begins with unusually warm ocean conditions along the west coast of South America and faltering of the trade winds.

Science/All (HSAPQ National History Bowl 2011)<br><strong>One of the earliest of these devices, co-created by Walter Brattain, was applied to a device that had the advantage of not needing to warm up, while a mechanism for producing many of these at once was developed by Jack Kilby.

One type of these named after Vaughan Jones and another named after James Alexander and John Conway are used to represent knots.  Descartes’ rule of signs is a method for determining the number of roots for one these, and these can be differentiated using the power and sum rules.

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>This relation, which was formulated by analyzing the spectra of galaxies, is currently believed to be caused by dark energy and is a variation of Doppler shift in the context of special relativity. Fainter, older galaxies were noted to have their spectrum shifted further to lower wavelengths, a result which supported the predictions of the Friedmann equations and indicated that other galaxies were moving away from our  galaxy. A more interesting observation showed that not only were galaxies in all regions of the sky moving away from the Milky Way, but they were also moving away from each other.

Science/Chemistry (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>One method of detecting the distance between a pair of these species is the PELDOR experiment. Introducing species like PNO, DMPO and TEMPO to short-lived versions of these species creates nitroxide-based persistent ones, which can then be imaged by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Halogenation reactions with these species as intermediates tend to lack stereospecificity. These species are created by homolysis when a halogenhalogen or halogencarbon bond is cleaved by </strong> UV light, which explains why CFCs are damaging.
