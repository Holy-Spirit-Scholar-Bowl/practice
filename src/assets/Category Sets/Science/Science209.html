Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>The differential cross section for two types of this phenomenon is given by the Klein-Nishina formula. One of those types is named for Thomson, while the other results in the decrease in energy of an X-ray or gamma ray photon. Reflections that do not undergo this phenomenon are known as specular.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>Used in carburetors to draw in fuel and mix it with the air, the Venturi effect is a case of this. In the Venturi effect, fluid flowing through a pipe with a constriction in it must satisfy the equation of continuity and the conservation of energy, thus producing a choked flow, used to control the delivery of water through spigots and valves. The fallacy of the equal-transit-time theory makes the popular explanation that lift on an airfoil is generated by this </strong> effect false.
