1. Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>The Cydonia region is home to this body’s infamous “Face.” Giovanni Schiaparelli observed a network of linear  structures on its surface but a mistranslation of his notes led to the belief that it contained canals and therefore life.  The tallest mountain in the Solar System is located on this body in its Tharsis region, and the Mariner 9 spacecraft, after which this planet's Valles Marineris is named, discovered that its Olympus Mons is a shield volcano. It is  orbited by two moons, Phobos and Deimos, and iron oxide on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. For 10  points, name this fourth planet from the Sun.<br>ANSWER: Mars<br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 11 2009)<br><strong>The Fermi satellite discovered that this phenomenon produces positrons. Sprites, elves, and blue jets are harder-to-observe variants of this phenomenon, and the positive type of it is more energetic.
