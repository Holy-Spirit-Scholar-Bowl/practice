1. Science/All (Fall Novice 2010)<br>These molecules' variable regions use induced fit to bind to epitopes. Human types of them include E, involved in allergic reactions, and M, a pentamer produced in response to mismatched blood transfusions. Autoimmune diseases occur when they mistakenly attack self, rather than foreign, molecules. They are produced by B cells and are also known as immunoglobins. For 10 points, name these proteins in the immune system that defend against antigens.<br>ANSWER: <u>antibodies</u> [accept <u>immunoglobins</u> until mentioned]<br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br><strong>A variant on this concept includes a video camera and an internal television. Objective collapse theories attempt to resolve this apparent paradox by setting size or complexity criteria. It was intended as a critique of the Copenhagen interpretation, and featured a </strong> hammer triggered to release and break a flask of hydrocyanic acid if an atom decays. For 10 points, name this thought experiment in which, until the box is opened, a superposition of live and dead states is the best way to describe the title creature.<br>ANSWER: Schrodinger's cat<br><br>3. Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2005)<br>On a p-T diagram, the slope of the maximal isotherm is zero at this point. A reduced variable is defined as the ratio of a state function to its value at this point, and it defines the top of the vapor dome. For 10 points, name this point on the phase diagram of a liquid-vapor mixture above which clearly defined liquid and vapor phases fail to exist.<br>ANSWER: <u>critical point</u><br><br>4. Science/Math (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Laguerre's method for finding these quantities is one of many algorithms that "polishes" them by repeatedly "deflating" a function. An algorithm that finds these quantities successively computes "x sub n" by subtracting the expression "f of x sub 0 divided by f prime of x sub 0" from "x sub n minus 1." An upper bound on the number of these quantities can be found with Descartes' </strong> Rule of Signs. There is no general method for finding these quantities for expressions higher than the fourth degree according to the AbelRuffini theorem. These quantities, which can be found using the Newton-Raphson method, are defined as inputs to a function such that it outputs zero.

Science/Biology (Maggie Walker GSAC 2012)<br>Aneuploidy is one possible consequence of this process failing. This process takes place during oogenesis in females, and terminalization and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope occur during its diakinesis phase. Synaptonemal complexes break down following the pachytene stage of this process that produces three polar bodies, after which bivalents are held together by chiasmata. Crossing over during this process adds genetic variation to resulting daughter cells. For 10 points, name this cell division process producing four gamete cells that occurs during sexual reproduction and is contrasted with mitosis.<br>ANSWER: Meiosis [accept Nondisjunction before oogenesis]<br><br>6. Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2004)<br>Gyroscopic procession can be understood when one realizes that gravity results in one of these, defined as the time derivative of angular momentum. This is the generalized force conjugate with an angular coordinate, and Euler’s laws specify the dynamics with this as generator.

Science/Physics (BHSAT 2013)<br>The landscape described by this formalism consists of roughly "ten to the five-hundred" metastable vacua. The spacetime geometry described by it incorporates worldsheets bound to D-branes, as well as compactified spaces. Criticism of it often focuses on the large number of free parameters in the theory, making it practically untestable; however, this formalism also provides a basis for the anthropic principle. In the mid-90s, Ed Witten revolutionized this field when he united all types of them into M-theory, which describes an 11-dimensional universe. For 10 points, name this theory of everything in which all matter is composed of namesake tiny loops of energy.<br>ANSWER: superstring theory<br><br>8. Science/Physics (LIST 2014)<br><strong>While not Hugh Everett, the formulator of this construct was motivated by the EPR paradox and wished to contradict the idea of wavefunction collapse. Influenced by complementarity, this argument sought to reveal the limitations in the Copenhagen interpretation, leading Everett to propose the many-worlds interpretation to resolve this </strong> paradox. Demonstrating the principle of superposition, this formulation involves the spontaneous decay of an atom, which ends up breaking a vial of hydrocyanic acid and killing the namesake animal.

Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>This object is not present in a series of models dubbed "Technicolor." One theory on how to produce one of these objects is based on gluons decaying into a top quark and its antiparticle, then fusing. Another theory on how they form involves the fusion of certain "W" and "Z" particles. The Standard Model predicts the existence of this particle, while conformation of its existence will hopefully be supplied by experiments in the Large Hadron Collider.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>The triphenyl derivative of this ion is commonly used as a flame retardant in cellulose acetate films. The charging of tRNA with amino acids leads to the release of a compound known as the “pyro” form, which consists of two of these ions linked together. The minerals known as apatites are characterized by the presence of this anion, which notably forms a weak </strong> triprotic acid that is often used at 85 percent concentration in the lab. It is released in the production of ADP from ATP and is a common trigger for eutrophication.

Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2005)<br>One of 2 technologies is used to perform it, either the Soderberg Method, which uses liquid pitch to continuously renew the required anode, or the Pre­Bake Method, which uses a more expensive but higher quality anode that does not degenerate nearly as fast as a Soderberg Anode. Monatomic carbon is added to a bath of liquid cryolite, Al 2 O 3 ore, and silver fluoride. As a result, carbon dioxide gas is released, the cryolite is unchanged, and pure metal forms a precipitate. Simultaneously but independently discovered by eponymous American and French industrialists was, for ten points, what process that turns aluminia ore into pure aluminum.<br>ANSWER: Hall­Héroult (HAHL­he­ROO) Process<br><br>13. Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>Because this process uses VKORC to recycle components, it can be inhibited by a coumarin derivative called warfarin. Tissue factor initiates the extrinsic pathway of this process, and when endothelial cells are damaged, its von Willebrand factor bonds to collagen. This process is inhibited by Bernard-Souleir syndrome and by another disorder caused by a lack of [*] factor VIII, disrupting this process’s namesake cascade. In this process, thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin strands that assist the platelet plug in closing the wound.

The citrate salt of this substance is sometimes used to treat infant sleep apnea. This trimethylxanthine has an effect similar to that of its derivative theobromine, and its action as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor slows the degradation of cAMP and results in increased norepinephrine and epinephrine production. Because of its similarity to a certain purine nucleoside, this compound can bind to, but not activate, receptors for </strong> adenosine in the brain, which results in increased alertness.

According to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the value for this property in an ideal gas equals two-thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas over k, the number of moles times the ideal gas constant.  The zeroeth law of thermodynamics involves three reservoirs with the same value for this property, and it appears along with number of moles and the gas constant on one side of the ideal gas equation.
