1. Science/All (Weekend of Quizbowl Saturday Event 2009)<br>The Wohl-Ziegler reaction utilizes allylic or benzylic addition of this to hydrocarbons using a radical initiator. An important step in daguerreotype development uses this element and mercury, and photograph developers use this to prevent undesired reduction of silver. The Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction adds this to carboxylic acids at the alpha position, and an intercalating agent with this element and ethidium is used as a fluorescent tag in gel electrophoresis. For ten points, identify this chemical element with number 35 and symbol Br.<br>ANSWER: <u>Bromine</u><br><br>2. Science/All (PACE NSC 2008)<br>In this experiment, sulfur from cigar smoke in the laboratory helped in easy visualization of the spots on the detectors. A variation of this experiment used sodium atoms and a time varying radio-frequency B field, resulting in oscillations named for its performer, I. I. Rabi.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>These organs are protected by namesake “rakers” which prevent food from entering them. Unusual examples of these are found behind the legs of horseshoe crabs, and in some animals they are accessed through spiracles.  Asteroidea [aas-tur-oh-ee-DAY-uh]-class animals have simple versions of these called papulae [PAA-pyoo-lay] just under their skin. These organs are supported by a cartilaginous [kar-tih-LAA-jih-nuss] arch and protected by an operculum [oh-PUR-kyoo-lum], and their primary structures are lamellae [LAA- mih-lay], which have very large surface areas. Name these organs which use a countercurrent system to extract large amounts of oxygen from water, found in fish.<br>ANSWER: gills<br><br>4. Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>Bad results in this technique can occur due to the "smiling" effect. Tris, EDTA, and either borate or acetate make up the most common buffer used in it. Mobility shift assays to study protein-DNA interactions use this technique. This procedure is the final step of Sanger sequencing, after chain-termination occurs from a ddNTP. The intercalating agent </strong> ethidium bromide is frequently used in this technique. The product of this procedure is blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and treated with radiolabelled probes in a technique named for Southern. In this technique, a comb is inserted into an agarose or polyacrylamide matrix to form wells. For 10 points, name this technique in which an electromotive force separates DNA fragments based on their length.<br>ANSWER: gel electrophoresis<br><br>5. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>Cadherins (cad-HERE-inz) and integrins (IN-tuh-grinz) are among the many proteins that span this structure, and flippases (FLIP-ay-suhz) aid molecule movement in it. The fluid mosaic model of this structure states that it is composed of structures like lipid rafts and protein complexes floating freely in a phospholipid bilayer (FOSS-fo-LIP-id BY-lay-ur). Ion channels aid ion transport through this entity to enter or exit the cell.

Science/Biology (SCOP Novice 2012)<br><strong>Some scholars believe this bodily process was once "segmented" between "first" and "second" stages. A CPAP machine is used to treat apnea during this process, and muscle paralysis often occurs during the </strong> REM form of this process. Circadian rhythm regulates the cycle of this process, a lack of which is called insomnia. For 10 points, name this process which is recommended to last eight to 10 hours.<br>ANSWER: sleep<br><br>7. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>The evolution of this construct is sometimes cited as a cause of the Cambrian explosion. Because of their toughness, these constructs are often used paleontologically to examine animals. Ecdysis occurs when an animal sheds one of these, which allow it to grow. All arthropods possess one of these.However, some animals, such as clams, have no need to do so—they simply add new material to the old one. Name this hard, external covering that is composed of chitin and can be strengthened with calcium carbonate, sometimes contrasted with endoskeletons.<br>ANSWER: <u>exoskeleton</u><br><br>8. Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>A positive response to the Paul-Bunnell heterophile antibody test indicates infection by this virus, and  the Miller-Hutt-Fletcher process is one way it can target cells. Marmoset cell immortality is a result of this  virus which can be responsible for both inhibition of the IL-10 receptor and promotion of autoimmune  disease states through polyclonal B cell expansion. FTP, name this B-cell infecting virus linked to  conditions like nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, Burkitt‟s lymphoma, Hodgkin‟s  Disease, and mononucleosis.<br>ANSWER: Epstein-Barr virus<br><br>9. Science/All (WUHSAC VIII 2006)<br>Craters on the moon and Mars are named for him, but he spent his life studying formations of rocks on Earth.  He started his professional life as a lawyer, but turned to his love of nature and developed the idea of stratigraphy. You may know him best from your biology class: his friendship with Darwin impacted the naturalist’s thinking. For ten points, name this famous geologist, author of The Geological Evidence of the Antiquity of Man, and the man behind uniformitarianism.<br>ANSWER: Charles <u>Lyell </u><br><br>10. Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>In a process named for these objects, a thick oxide layer is applied to a metal to make it more durable. That process is most commonly applied to aluminum. To prevent corrosion, especially in marine environments, zinc coatings often are used as a "sacrificial" sort of this device. Chlorine gas is formed at this device when salt water is electrolysed. Electrons flow into a galvanic cell at this terminal, which is negatively charged, and which is where oxidation occurs.

Science/Chemistry (BHSAT 2013)<br>In VSEPR ("vesper") theory, there are this many lone pairs on the central atom in trigonal bipyramidal molecules. Each element in group 2 of the periodic table has this number of valence-shell p-orbital electrons. In natural units, this is the dipole moment of a homonuclear diatomic molecule. When an element undergoes beta decay, its mass number changes by this much. To the nearest integer, this is the pH of one-molar nitric acid. By extrapolating Charles's law and locating the x-intercept on the Kelvin scale, one can find this temperature, which cannot be reached by any physical apparatus.

Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>The van’t Hoff equation applies this concept to thermodynamics, which explains why raising temperature will reduce the amount of product in the Haber process. This statement explains why dissociating sodium acetate along with acetic acid will suppress the ionization of acetic acid and increase the pH of the </strong> buffer solution, supporting the common-ion effect. According to this principle, adding a noble gas does not result in a shift, and this principle also explains why the addition of more reactant will tip a reaction towards the product side. For 10 points, identify this principle which states that an equilibrium will shift to accommodate any changes, named for a French chemist.<br>ANSWER: <u>Le Chatelier's</u> principle<br><br>13.

Medical technicians often use Fluorine Eighteen, which also gives off neutrinos and oxygen, to create these particles. First postulated by Paul Dirac in 1928, some scientists thought that credit for discovering them should have gone to Blackett and Occhialini for their development of cloud chambers and their careful measurements, but credit is usually given to Carl Anderson.

Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>The British Flag Theorem deals with sums of squares of distances from an interior point in this figure. Cutting a square off the “golden” variety of this figure yields another “golden” one, and gluing two opposite edges of this figure after giving it a half-twist yields a </strong> Mobius strip. This figure’s diagonal has length equal to the square root of the sum of the squares of its two perpendicular sides, a consequence of all of its angles being right.
