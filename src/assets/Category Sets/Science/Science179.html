1. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>There is debate that this phylum should be split up because it is arguably polyphyletic. This phylum, along with arthropods, and other smaller phyla, makes up a larger group called Ecdysozoa. These pseudocoelomates possess only longitudinal muscle cells, which they contract in order to move. Sydney Brenner did extensive work with one member of this phylum, and members of this phylum have four peripheral nerves that run along the length of its body; those nerves create a dense ring near the pharynx and serve as the brain. Name this phylum of roundworms which includes such organisms as C. elegans and hookworms.<br>ANSWER: <u>nematoda</u><br><br>2. Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>In computer programming, this word precedes "violation" in a form of error caused when a program accepts inputs it can't operate on. In law, these legal constructs require a "meeting of the minds" after an offer and an acceptance. A metaphorical type of these entities, which was updated into the "original position" by John Rawls, involves treating all people as the "sovereign" and upholding their "general will". One of these "with America" was offered in the 1994 Congressional midterm elections by Newt Gingrich's Republicans.

Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>Theories surrounding their formation include localized heating due to asteroid impacts. Although some geologists claim their effects can be explained entirely through plate tectonics and localized interactions between the upper mantle and the crust, they are generally believed to be the product of upwelling from the lower mantle in the form of a mantle plume. When under continental crust, they tend to form powerful rhyolite volcanos such as the Yellowstone Caldera, while those under oceanic crust form weaker basalt volcanos such as Hawaii. For 10 points, name these fixed points on the Earth's surface with continuous volcanism that leave trails on moving tectonic plates.<br>ANSWER: <u>hotspots</u><br><br>8. Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 1 2008)<br>The runtime of algorithms that employ this paradigm can be found with the Akkra-Bazzi method or the Master theorem, and it can be less efficient than other methods due to the need to store the call stack.
