Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2004)<br>These devices work on the principle of full Townshend avalanche, or gas multiplication, and have a relatively low counting efficiency due to the high relaxation time resulting there from. The bias range of these devices, generally on the order of kilovolts, is well above the proportional limit, so they cannot be used to perform particle energy spectroscopy, but every charged particle entering ideally produces a single “blip” or “click.” For ten points, name these common, simple particle detectors useful for getting a rough estimate of the level of ionizing radiation in an area.<br>ANSWER: <u>Geiger</u>-Mueller counters (or <u>Geiger</u>-Mueller tubes or <u>Geiger</u>- Mueller detectors; accept <u>G-M tube</u>s or <u>G-M counter</u>s or <u>G-M detector</u>s)<br><br>2.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>One mystery involving these objects with extremely long life spans is the presence of metals, an observation that suggests these entities were not part of the first generation of stars, since low mass stars cannot form without metals. During their long lives, they are not massive enough to initiate helium fusion so they slowly burn hydrogen and contract for billions of years.

Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>A Trofile assay distinguishes M and T-tropism based on receptors present on these cells' surfaces. The follicular type of these cells are CXCR5 and CXCR4 positive and localize to the Peyer's patches. Upon activation by Signal 1 and Signal 2, these cells secrete interleukin-2 but not perforin. The delta-32 mutation in the CCR5 gene greatly enhances </strong> survival of these cells. When mature, all of these cells express CD4, the protein targeted by gp120, on their surfaces. A disease that primarily targets them commonly presents with Kaposi's sarcoma.
