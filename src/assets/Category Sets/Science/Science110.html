Science/Math (New Trier Scobol Solo 2014)<br>The path integral in Green's theorem is confined to one of these surfaces, but the path integral in Stokes' theorem is not. Two lines are classified as skew if they are not contained by one of these surfaces. The intersection of two of these surfaces forms a dihedral angle, and if two distinct examples of these surfaces intersect, the intersection is a line. In coordinate geometry, the equation of one of these surfaces often uses its normal vector. In space, this surface can represent the set of points equidistant from two points.
