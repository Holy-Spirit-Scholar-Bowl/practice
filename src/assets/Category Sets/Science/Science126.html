Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Districts 2011)<br>Two different types of these proteins are used in sandwich assays. These proteins can be further divided into classes such as opsonins and agglutinins (uh-GLUE-tin-ins). These proteins can be classified as polyclonal or monoclonal depending on the B lymphocytes they are produced by. These proteins consist of two heavy and two light chains, arranged in a Y shape, and their variable regions interact with epitopes.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>This phenomenon can be advantageous in haplotype analysis when mapping the spread of disease and linkage disequilibrium. This is possible because regions in linkage disequilibrium encompass greater chromosomal distances. After the 1883 Krakatoa eruption, which erased all life on the island that remained, new populations of organisms experienced this after their arrival. The settlers of Quebec also demonstrated this phenomenon when they exhibited minimal genetic variation even after an eighty-fold change in population. Sometimes caused by a population bottleneck, it can occur even though the separate group is not strictly a new population.

Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2010)<br>On a phase diagram, it can be determined by finding the area under the curve.  The amount of it done on a system can be found by subtracting the amount of heat added from the internal energy of the system.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>This body of water contains an entity known as the “black stream,” and the Andesite line delineates between andesitic and mafic rocks in it. The Louisville hotspot lies underneath it, and the Humboldt current here sees high primary productivity due to upwelling. The Kuroshio current lies in this entity whose changing location relative to a hotspot created the Emperor seamount chain. Weakened trade winds over this entity cause its eastern portion to heat up and upwelling to stop, disrupting fisheries, in one phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation.
