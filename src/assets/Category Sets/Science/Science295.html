Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>Angelman syndrome results from this type of inheritance due to paternal imprinting, and this concept   has been used to explain why the children of women pregnant during the Dutch famine of 1944 show  a greater incidence of obesity and diabetes. This mode of inheritance for the mouse agouti  gene can   produce identical twins with different coat colors and is not thought to exist in plants, most of whose  cells remain totipotent. This phenomenon controls animal cell differentiation and works by histone  acetylation or DNA methylation.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament 2010)<br>The cohesion of these entities is mediated by a GP IIb/IIIa receptor. Their dense granules contain nucleotides, ATP, calcium, and serotonin, and among the growth factors they secrete from their alpha granules are TGF-beta and fibronectin. One receptor deficiency in these structures weakens their interaction with the von Willebrand factor secreted by the endothelium of blood vessels. They form by pinching off of large, multinucleate cells called megakaryocytes, and aspirin inhibits their function by irreversibly inactivating COX-1 enzymes, which inhibits the clotting cascade.

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>An apparatus named for Kugelrohr performs one type of it over short paths. One type of this process exploits Raoult's law to increase or decrease the vapor pressure of the substance, and may be more useful than another type which produces better results when the number of theoretical plates are increased, but cannot separate azeotropes.

Science/All (BHSAT 2012)<br>One theory of this phenomenon suggests that it occurs when cosmic rays trigger a runaway avalanche of particles, and it may itself trigger terrestrial gamma-ray flashes. A descending stepped leader connects to a return stroke along an ionized channel that subsequently is superheated by this phenomenon, producing a shock wave. This process may produce fulgurites, a form of glass.

Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>This condition is met in an iterative process called tatonnement, or groping, according to a certain model of an auction. In The Strategy of Conflict, Thomas Schelling proposed focal points as these types of conditions in coordination games. In exogenous growth models, an economy meets this condition when the variables describing it reach a balanced growth. The general type of this condition is the subject of a theory proposed by Leon </strong> Walras. According to another theory, this condition is met when a mixed strategy minimizes the maximum loss.
