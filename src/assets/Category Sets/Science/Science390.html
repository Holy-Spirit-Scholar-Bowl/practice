1. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2008)<br>Geography/Earth Science/Astronomy  It is popularly considered the alpha star in the constellation that also includes Muliphen and Murzim. In 1862, it was discovered to be a binary star, and one of the stars is now known to be a white dwarf that is ten thousand times dimmer than the other one. In some cultures, its appearance marked the beginning of Summer. Name this star with a visual magnitude of negative one point four three, making it the brightest star in the night sky.<br>ANSWER: Sirius (accept Dog Star) (prompt Alpha Canus Major(is), but do not accept Canus Major)<br><br>2. Science/All (WUHSAC XI 2009)<br>These small basic proteins contain large amounts of arginine and lysine, and have a net positive charge which facilitates their binding to negatively charged DNA. There are 5 main types of them, and chromatin contains approximately equal amounts of them and DNA by mass. For 10 points, name these proteins which act as cores for DNA to wrap tightly around, which helps compact the DNA into chromosome structures.<br>ANSWER: <u>histone</u>(s)<br><br>3. Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>In a similar mechanism to that used by some nematodes, this organ secretes neurokinin B, which allows suppression of the immune system. In Metatheria, the nutrients it supplies are derived mainly from the egg sac. Administration of Rhogam prevents erythroblastosis fetalis, which can be caused by IgG antibodies crossing it. Abruption of it can be triggered by infection or trauma, but is most often caused by high blood pressure. It develops from the trophoblast and produces progesterone, estrogen, and hCG, and failure to remove it after birth can cause hemorrhaging. For 10 points, name this organ that provides nutrients to developing fetuses through the umbilical cord.<br>ANSWER: <u>placenta</u><br><br>4. Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>One formula approximating the mass of these objects contains an asymmetry term and is named after Bethe and Weizsacker. George Gamow proposed the liquid drop model to explain the shape of these objects. The composition of these structures relate to “magic numbers” as predicted by the shell model, though deformations must be accounted for in their </strong> “island of stability.” These entities were notably missing from the J.J. Thomson’s “plum pudding” model and were shown to exist in an experiment in which Rutherford fired alpha particles at a piece of gold foil.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>For a poset, this concept is the size of the smallest realizer. Topological covers are central to the Lebesgue and Hausdorff definitions of this concept. One generalization defines this characteristic as the trace of the identity map. For any linear map, this value for the image, plus this value for the kernel, gives this value for the domain. For a vector space, it is defined as the number of elements in any basis. In Cartesian space, it is the number of coordinates needed to specify a point.

Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This disease is theorized to be caused by abnormalities resulting from hyper-phosphorylation (fos-FAWR-uh-ley-shun) of tau proteins. Another hypothesis concerning the cause of this disease suggests that a buildup of beta-amyloid (AM-uh-loid) causes characteristic tangles and plaques in the brain. Other evidence suggests it is caused by a deficiency of acetylcholine (uh-seet-l-KOH-leen). For 10 points, name this disease that causes memory loss in its elderly sufferers.<br>ANSWER: <u>Alzheimer’s</u> disease<br><br>9. Science/All (Maryland Spring 2012)<br>The Hughes-Drever experiment is one of the most accurate confirmations of this theory. Dirac’s version of Schrodinger’s wave equation for spin one half is consistent with this theory. In this theory, a certain addition formula is replaced by U plus V over one plus U times V. Lorentz is partially credited with this theory because he proposed length contraction to explain the Michelson-Morley experiment.
