Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>This concept establishes the distinction between noesis and noemata and concludes that knowing essences requires bracketing existence in a process known as epoché. Maurice Merleau-Ponty, a proponent of the existential version of this concept, agreed with such notables as Sartre and Heidegger in his rejection of a transcendental ego. It is generally held to have been first posited in its modern form in the 1913 work Ideas by Edmund Husserl, but Hegel’s unrelated work about this concept “of spirit” well predates him.

It justifies the rule of thumb that, if you count N events, the uncertainty in the number is given by the square root of N. Also called the “law of small numbers,” it says the probability that an event occurs N times is given by e to the minus x, times x to the N, divided by N factorial, where x is the expected number of events.
