Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>In the 1970s, the Bilger report contradicted the NIH's wishes to disband all research related to this technology, and in the 1980s the NIH gave a grant to Australia's Graham Clark to further develop the multi-channel version of this device.

Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>Paul Samuelson applied this concept to economics to imply that elasticities are lower in the short run than in the long run. Lenz's law is the manifestation of this concept in physics, and, in chemistry, this concept can suppress the ionization of a weak acid or a weak base and is used in buffer solutions in the common ion effect.

Science/All (BHSAT 2012)<br>These numbers can be defined as the members of the only complete, ordered Archimedean field. One way of constructing them is by dividing a certain subset of these numbers that is dense in them into two disjoint subsets, one of which has no greatest element. The conjecture that there is no set with cardinality between that of these numbers and that of the integers is inconsistent with ZFC set theory. That conjecture is the continuum hypothesis. These numbers are not algebraically closed, since polynomials with these numbers as coefficients can have roots such as “i”, the square root of negative one.

Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>Electron-phonon interactions cause this quantity to increase with temperature roughly linearly in most metals and to decrease exponentially in semiconductors.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>The Saccheri quadrilateral and the Lambert quadrilateral were among the first theorems on this topic. One form can be described by four models, while another has three. In one model, the cross-ratio is used to describe distances. They are useful for modeling space, since one type can describe the edges of the universe where no matter exists, and since the theory of relativity states that space is curved where there is matter. In another model, called the hyperspheric model, lines are modeled by great circles. They do not obey the parallel postulate, </strong> since in the hyperbolic type there are infinitely many lines intersecting a point A not on a line L, and in the elliptical type all lines intersect.
