Science/Other (Masonic 2014)<br>A genetic disease impacting the body's use of this element is acrodermatitis enteropathica [a-kroe-dehr-mah-TIE-tis en-TEH-roe-pa-thih-kah]. A deficiency in this nutrient contributes to anorexia and prevents the creation of testosterone. This nutrient is often found in high concentrations in the same foods that contain iron, calcium, magnesium, and proteins, including oysters and veal liver. Too much of this nutrient can prevent the body from using copper. Name this element whose oxide is used to decrease sunburn and which shortens cold symptoms.<br>ANSWER: Zinc<br><br>3. Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>This quantity’s substantial time derivative is zero according to the continuity equation, which means that this quantity is constant for an incompressible fluid. The constant of proportionality between the kinematic and dynamic viscosities, this quantity can be measured by a pycnometer. The volume integral of this quantity is the mass. Archimedes’ principle dictates that objects float in a fluid if their value for this is less than the value for this the fluid.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>This region has an inverse quartic brightness slope, and at a one-to-two resonance, it has a namesake “cliff.” Divided into cold and hot populations, this region is home to Weywot and Quaoar. It is thought to be the source of centaurs and its outer edge overlaps with the scattered disc. Varuna, Haumea, Sedna, and other cubewanos lie in this region, which is also the source of short-period comets. It lies much closer to the sun than the Oort cloud, and is home to trans-Neptunian objects like Pluto.

Science/All (BHSAT 2010)<br>This principle can be derived from the law of conservation of energy, and a particular case of this is Torricelli’s theorem. Another effect derived from this is the Venturi effect, which describes a reduction of pressure under certain conditions. This principle holds only for inviscid flow and can be applied to gases at low Mach number. FTP, name this principle, which states that an increase in the speed of a fluid can occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure or potential energy, and which can be used to explain the  phenomena of lift and curveballs.<br>ANSWER: Bernoulli's principle<br><br>8. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This element violates the Madelung rule by having ten electrons in the 3d orbital. Speculum metal is composed of tin and this element. The sulfate of this element is commonly used along with steel wool to demonstrate exothermic reactions. On the periodic table, it is in the same family as silver and gold.

Science/All (DAFT 2009)<br>One member of this phylum can cause a painful condition known as Irukandji syndrome; that condition is caused by one class of this phylum known as Cubozoa. These organisms reproduce asexually by dividing into segments in a process called strobilation and since they lack any real skeletal structure, their bodies are composed of a substance called mesoglea. They contain a poisonous cell called a nematocyte and their body shape divides into polyp and medusa forms. The Portuguese Man o' War is part of, for 10 points, this animal phylum that includes coral, sea anemone, and jellyfish.<br>ANSWER: Cnidaria<br><br>10. Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>Oxidation of this molecule leads to the formation of phaseic acid, one of its activated forms. It is formed after a molecule of Violaxanthin degrades into xanthonin, which changes into an aldehyded form of this. It prevents the uptake of kinetin and slows alpha-amylase synthesis through inhibition of gibberellins. By changing the potassium ion concentration outside guard cells it causes stomata to close when water is scarce, and it induces dormancy by inhibiting shoot growth and seed germination.

Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>These things are defined by being left-total and right-unique. A set of these things is denoted by "raising" one set to the power of another set. They are typically denoted by a name followed by a colon, a set, an arrow, and another set. The arity of one of these things is the number of arguments it accepts. These things are said to be "partial" rather than "total" if they are not defined on their entire domain. A circle-symbol between two of these things denotes composition. These relations are single-valued, and thus pass the vertical line test. For 10 points, name these relations that map each input to exactly one output, examples of which are "sine" and "logarithm".<br>ANSWER: <u>function</u>s [or <u>operation</u>s; or total <u>function</u>s; prompt on "binary relations"; prompt on "relations"]<br><br>12. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>Madden-Julian Oscillation usually occurs a year before these events though rarely during these events, and Walker Circulation tends to be weaker during these events. These events have also coincided with decreases in hurricane formation in the Atlantic and these events cause a decrease in upwelling off the Pacific coast of South America. This event is the warm phase of Southern Oscillation on the tropical Pacific Ocean.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>The first of these type of materials was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1833 when he was studying the properties of silver sulfide. Frenkel excitons generally form in these materials when they are exposed to photons that have energies in or near the visible range of the spectrum. These materials observe an increase in resistivity when they are cooled, unlike metals such as copper. Graphite behaves like one of these because of its extensive pi-delocalization, allowing access to conduction bands. Conductivity of these materials is modified by doping. For 10  points, name these materials which have a resistivity between that of conductors and insulators.<br>ANSWER: semiconductors<br><br>15. Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>Alternating light and dark bands in these objects are called ogives. They can form U-shaped valleys with knife-like rock ridges called aretes between them. They lose mass in their zones of ablation, and they create teardrop-shaped hills called drumlins. Temperate ones are so called because they are at melting point year-round, and they form sediments characterized as “terminal” and “lateral.” For 10 points, name these entities that form moraines lakes when their debris dams a stream and that form icebergs when they break apart.<br>ANSWER: <u>glaciers</u><br><br>16.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br><strong>One part of this layer was discovered by Inge Lehmann, and just above this layer is the Gutenberg Discontinuity. S waves are completely absent in this region, which lies beneath the D-Double-Prime layer. Part of this layer is made of nickel-iron fluid whose </strong> eddy currents are responsible for the Earth's magnetic field. The lowest part of this layer is solid because of intense pressure.

Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm was the first one to use these devices to deterministically solve a problem faster than classical methods, and critical components of them are modeled by Bloch spheres. Using Grover’s algorithm, these devices can search an unsorted database in sub-linear time, and they are difficult to make and maintain due to the phenomenon of </strong> decoherence. Shor’s Algorithm can be run on these devices to factor integers in polynomial time, ruining RSA encryption, and their namesake objects can be 0, 1, or a superposition of the two.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>The extinct Maclurites of this class are a characteristic fossil of the Ordovician Period, and members of its genus Murex were long the source of the royal dye Tyrian purple. Some species in this class serve as intermediate hosts to the schistosomiasis (shis-tuh-soh-MAI-uh-sis) flukes that can infest rice paddies and all show unexpectedly asymmetric bodies due to torsion in the developing embryo. The most venomous creature in the ocean is the cone species from this class and members of its prosobranch subgroup can retract their bodies inside their mantle-secreted shells.

Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>Nicholas Mackintosh's predictions about attentional changes in this phenomenon were contradicted by the Pearce-Hall model. Kamin blocking, which inhibits this phenomenon, can be explained with the Rescorla-Wagner model of it. Latent inhibition limits the efficacy of this phenomenon, whose second-order variety involves three cognitive steps. An experiment co-led by Rosalie Raynor showed how it often causes </strong> stimulus generalization. This method of learning was demonstrated in an experiment where a loud noise led a baby to fear all white, furry objects. John Watson's "Little Albert" experiment echoed one in which dogs were taught to drool at the ring of a bell via this phenomenon.
