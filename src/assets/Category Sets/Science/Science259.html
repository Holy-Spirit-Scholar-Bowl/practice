1. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>The NASA IBEX is now mapping this phenomenon, and scientists believe that the craft observed a reflection of this. Some scientists believe that Earth could not have had an atmosphere until its iron core condensed because of this phenomenon. An unknown mechanism in the polar oval causes this phenomenon to accelerate as it passes through Earth's magnetosphere, and it also forms a solar system-sized bubble in the interstellar medium called the heliosphere. This phenomenon forces the tails of comets to always point away from the Sun, while its periodic flares can cause geomagnetic storms that knock out power grids. Also responsible for the Northern and Southern Lights, name this continuous stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun's corona.<br>ANSWER: solar <u>wind</u> [prompt on <u>solar flares</u> before “<u>flares</u>”]<br><br>2. Science/Biology (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2014)<br><strong>This structure's normal function is affected by Brugada syndrome, and its performance is measured by the stroke volume. It's not a digestive organ, but regurgitation can occur when this organ is defective. Bundle branches and Purkinje fibers relay signals that the </strong> SA and AV nodes produce to regulate the activity of this organ, which contains two semilunar valves and is surrounded by the pericardium.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>Optical frequency combs are used to improve the accuracy of these devices. Norman Ramsey proposed using a second microwave pulse to cancel out Doppler shifts in a precursor to these devices designed by Harold Lyons that placed ammonia molecules in a waveguide absorption cell. These devices were placed aboard airliners in the Hafele-Keating experiment, which was a test of </strong> special relativity. Modern examples of these devices typically use cold Cesium-133 or Rubidium-87, and they work by exploiting the frequency of transition between states of atoms.

Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2005)<br>In 1846, he was given a patent for his most­famous device. However, it sold poorly and he moved to England to make improvements on his machine, only to return the next year and find that his devices were being mass produced and selling greatly – a discovery that led to a lengthy patent infringement suit against Isaac Singer.

Science/Biology (Masonic 2014)<br>This hormone and adrenaline both bind to 7TM receptors, which increases cyclic AMP, which in turn activates protein kinase A [KIH-nase A]. This hormone stimulates a process involving malate [MAL-ate] that takes place largely in the liver.
