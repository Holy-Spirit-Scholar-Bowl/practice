Another, caused by a spirochetal bacterium, was dubbed The French Disease by Girolamo Fracastoro in a 1530 epic poem. A third is asymptomatic when found in the cervix but causes cloudy white discharge from the male urethra.

Science/All (Bulldog High School Academic Tournament (BHSAT) 2008)<br>The current recipe sometimes calls for ingredients like allspice, cloves, and cinnamon, but popular components upon its introduction to Europe included blueberries, walnuts, cucumbers, cranberries, and anchovies. That last ingredient isn't surprising as it started as an Eastern Asian term for any sauce typically made of mushrooms or fish brine. Though sometimes stored in glass bottles, it is more often found in plastic squeeze bottles, with newer designs optimized for “upside-down” orientation. FTP, name this popular lycopene-containing condiment, a tomato-based Heinz moneymaker.<br>ANSWER: <u>ketchup</u><br><br>3. Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>As-Sufi described it as the “little cloud,” while it was compared to a “candle shining through horn” by Simon Marius, and no definite explanation has been given to account for its two nuclei. Le Gentil is a satellite of it, as are the Pegasus and Cassiopeia Dwarves, while Mayall II is the brightest globular cluster in this object. A blue-shifted galaxy, it is currently approaching Earth at around 300 kilometers per second. Also known as M31, FTP, identify this galaxy, the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.<br>ANSWER: Great <u>Andromeda</u> Spiral Galaxy<br><br>4. Science/All (PACE NSC 2002)<br>The essential step involves combining CO2 with RuBP. The series yields an unstable intermediate, which breaks down into two molecules of phosphoglycerate, or PGA. Six revolutions of the cycle means that six CO2 molecules react with six RuBP molecules to produce 12 molecules of PGA. For 10 points—identify this second stage of photosynthesis, which is actually dependent on temperature rather than light.<br>ANSWER: <u>dark reactions</u> [prompt on <u>Calvin</u>-Benson Cycle]<br><br>5. Science/Chemistry (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>For the folding of the barnase protein at room temperature, this value is negative in accordance with the funnel model. One method of finding this value involves finding the slope of a line when plotting the inverse temperature against the natural logarithm of k. This value can be found by locating the saddle points on a potential energy surface. The rate constant is equal to an expression including the exponential of this value divided by RT, all times the </strong> pre-exponential factor, which is an expression named for Arrhenius. Catalysts accelerate reactions by lowering this value. For 10 points, name this quantity, which is the energy required to initiate a chemical reaction.<br>ANSWER: activation energy [or E-a or E-sub-a; prompt on \"transition state\" or \"transition state energy\"]<br><br>6. Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>Long chain compounds of this type may be synthesized from symmetric alkyl halides using the original Wurtz reaction and, by increasing carbon number, its members have positional isomer numbers 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 18, 75, et cetera. Members of this series may be prepared via hydrolysis of Grignard reagents; all lack color and those with between 5 and 15 carbons are liquid at standard conditions. These will produce atomic carbon when burned in deficient oxygen, and are also known as paraffins.

Science/All (BHSAT 2014)<br>Puromycin terminates this process prematurely by preventing an eEF2-catalyzed step called translocation. In prokaryotes, the 16S component must pair with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence before this process can begin, and in eukaryotes, GTP hydrolysis powers movement from the A site to the P site. Upon discovering that a molecule involved in this process had fewer than 61 varieties, Crick proposed wobble pairing. This process is initiated by AUG, which is a sequence that codes for methionine. In it, tRNAs match their anticodons to codons.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>The Knudsen type occurs at low pressures in porous media and is governed by the Einstein-Smoluchowski relation, while the Bohm type occurs in plasmas acted upon by a magnetic field. Used in doping semiconductors, it is governed by two laws named after Adolf Fick. Another law states that the rate at which it occurs is inversely proportional to the square root of the particles' masses. That law is named after the man who first studied it in liquids and gases, Thomas Graham. When it causes a solvent to move through a semi-permeable membrane, it is called osmosis. Caused by the random collisions of particles, for 10 points, name this transport phenomenon resulting in a net flow of molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration.<br>ANSWER: <u>diffusion</u> (prompt on “ <u>effusion</u> ” until “ semiconductors ” is read)<br><br>11. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q1 2009)<br>When followed by the word negative, this term describes gain-of-function changes that often involve competitive inhibition. Carl Collens discovered the incomplete form of this concept, which can be seen in the Merle modifier in dogs and in the color of carnations. When preceded by the prefix co-, it can describe the roan color of horses and the ABO blood group system.

Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>Beatty's Theorem applies to a pair of numbers of this type. They form a set of measure one in the interval (0,1), and their indicator function can therefore be Lebesgue integrated, but not Riemann integrated over this interval, as illustrated by a function which is continuous only on these named for Dirichlet. They can be generated from another set of numbers by employing Dedekind cuts. The square root of any integer that is not a perfect square is, FTP, one of what class of real numbers that cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers, such as pi and e?<br>ANSWER: <u>irrational</u> numbers<br><br>15. Science/All (WUHSAC VIII 2006)<br>One scientist studying their communication has asserted that their language contains nouns, adjectives and verbs, and that different colonies possess their own dialects. They are occasionally kept as pets, but this practice was questioned in 2003 when they spread monkeypox to twelve humans. Perhaps these rodents are better left alone in their underground burrows. For ten points, what are these furry critters native to the Western US with a canine name?<br>ANSWER: <u>prairie dog</u>s<br><br>16. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>This non-parasitic disease is often associated with desquamation in Curschmann’s spirals and Charcot-Leyden crystals from eosinophil breakdown. It is dependent on IL-4, a promoter of Th2 cell differentiation and IgE synthesis, which prompts mast cells to release pro-inflammatory substances. Spirometry is used to diagnose this disease treated with beclomethasone. While not allergies, the hygiene hypothesis addresses its modern prevalence. It can be triggered by mold, animal dander, or dust, and is temporarily relieved by beta2 agonists administered by nebulizer or inhaler. For 10 points, name this respiratory inflammatory disease that results in recurrent airway constriction, wheezing, and difficulty breathing.<br>ANSWER: 17\.

Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>A high pressure jump near it indicated that the transition from high field phase to paramagnetic phase is first order for Helium.  The ITS-90 temperature scale uses a portion of this value for Neon, Oxygen, and other materials as definitions for some of their temperature points. For water it occurs about .01 degrees Celsius above the normal freezing point.  For most substances the liquid phase can only occur at higher temperatures, and in all substances it can only occur at higher pressures.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament 2010)<br>A homeomorphism has a continuous one of these, and every element of a group has a unique one. An involution is equal to its associated one, and over a finite-dimensional vector space, an operator has one of these if it is either surjective or injective. If a function is not one-to-one, one of these may be formed by restricting the domain, and the graph of one of these in the Cartesian plane is the same as the original graph flipped around y=x.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>Bacteria might utilize FtsZ for this process, while plants necessitate the formation of a phragmoplast during it. In this process, GTPase RhoA is responsible for directing myosin II activation and actin formation to produce a contractile ring. One exceptional form of this process occurs in oogenesis, when the polar bodies get very little cytoplasm and organelles compared to the ovum. This process generally produces a cleavage furrow, resulting in two cells with equal amounts of material, and it takes place after telophase in mitosis.
