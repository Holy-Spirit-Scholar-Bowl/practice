Science/Math (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>A matrix with this property and one that is upper triangular is given by the QR decomposition. Given a linearly independent set of vectors x, a process that gives a set with this property computes a set of vectors v as v-sub-n equals x-sub-n minus the sum from i equals one to n minus one of the projection of v-sub-n along x-sub-i. That process is named for Gram & Schmidt and gives a basis that can later be normalized.
