He is the first namesake of a statistical distribution with a plus one term in the denominator. The Drake equation is an attempt to explain this man’s namesake paradox. When a quantum system is perturbed, the transition rate between eigenstates is given by this man’s namesake golden rule. He imagined the weak nuclear force to be a result of four particles meeting at one vertex, his namesake interaction, and those particles all have half-integer spin, making them his namesake particles.

Science/All (Maryland Spring 2012)<br>The SAC is a checkpoint in this process which prevents activity of APC until correct attachment and tension is detected. Megakaryocytes undergo a variant of this process in which they becomes polyploid. Kinetochores and centrosomes attach to microtubules in this process, lining chromosomes up along an equatorial plate. The end of this process sees the cleavage furrow complete and is called cytokinesis, though more properly the final step of this process is telophase in which two daughter nuclei form around the separated chromosomes.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>In photochemical reactions, triplet transition states but not singlets have this property, and Neel relaxation is observed in particles exhibiting the “super-” form of it. A Brillouin (BREEL-won) curve plots changes in this property against the ratio of auxiliary field strength to temperature, and the behavior of materials with this property is approximated by Curie’s law. These objects do not demonstrate hysteresis (his-tur-EE-sis) but do have a permeability stronger than that of free space. Free radicals and liquid oxygen demonstrate this property because it is the result of the spins of unpaired electrons.

This phenomenon is modeled as a double-well potential between donors and acceptors. SN1 reactions, but not SN2, are sped up by solvents demonstrating this effect. It is often incorrectly given as the reason for the higher melting temperatures of CG-rich DNA sequences. This interaction occurs perpendicular to the chains of antiparallel </strong> beta sheets and links the amide groups of every fourth residue of an alpha helix.
