Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>A "wild" one is one that has not been given a specific value. Its functionality can be duplicated with a one-dimensional array. When one is "double indirect," it means there are two of these before the actual data can be found. They are crucial in the creation of linked lists. Arithmetic with them involves moving up and down a number of bytes depending on the data type being referenced.

Science/Physics (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>The XENON research project uses a dual phase time projection chamber to search for this component, whose distribution is plotted on a NavarroFrenkWhite profile. The cusp-core problem has led to the suggestion that this component is self-interacting. Plots of orbital velocities of bodies against radial distance on a galactic rotation curve lead to the inference of this component, which </strong> Fritz Zwicky postulated after studying the Coma Cluster. Mordehai Milgrom developed MOND, or Modified Newtonian Dynamics, as an alternative to this entity.
