On the molecular scale, this phenomenon is caused by deformation of irregularities in surfaces and subsequent heat loss. This force allows a wheel to roll without slipping and has a model named for Coulomb. That model for this force states that for a body at rest it is less than or equal to the normal force times a namesake coefficient, and it has static and kinetic varieties.

Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>In the Coulomb gauge, this is the volume integral of charge density over distance, so its nth spherical moment falls off as one over distance to the n; thus, this field for a dipole falls off as one over distance squared. The negative gradient of this quantity is the static electric field.

The graph of this function of r in polar coordinates is centered at the Cartesian point zero comma one-half, and is a circle with its lowest point at the origin. This function also gives the imaginary component of a complex exponential function. The law named for this function is helpful to find an unknown side length of a triangle given one side length and the angles opposite those two sides.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>During DNA replication in eukaryotes, flap endonucleases remove RNA nucleotides extended by DNA polymerase III. In eukaryotes they are generally between 100 to 200 nucleotides long, while they are between 1,000 to 2,000 nucleotides long in E. coli. Due to the antiparallel nature of DNA strands, only one continuous strand of DNA can be synthesised at the 3' end of the leading strand. In order to compensate, these sequences of nucleotides appear in the lagging strand of DNA.
