1. Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2010)<br><strong>The Hessian matrix has entries which have undergone this operation twice and Clairaut's theorem states that for a function of many variables, the order of performing this operation does not matter. The dot product of a unit vector and a gradient of a function is known as the 'directional' variety of this operation.

As those of some archaea contain pseudomurein, beta-lactam drugs that target this structure would be ineffective against them. Endotoxins are released by some gram-negative bacteria after this structure is destroyed, and those bacteria cannot retain crystal violet in it during </strong> Gram staining because the peptidoglycan layer is thin.
