1. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>Dayton Miller’s attempt to recreate this experiment was unsuccessful, possibly because he did not control for temperature gradients. It was carried out in the basement of a stone building on top of a stone apparatus, using a pool of mercury to reduce vibration. A variation performed later by Kennedy and Thorndike required time dilation in addition to the length contraction used to explain this experiment whose results were further verified by the Ives-Stilwell experiment. It was performed in 1887 at Western Reserve University, and its results led to the development of Lorentz transformations. The people who carried it out did not correctly interpret its negative result. Name this experiment which attempted to use an interferometer to find the luminiferous ether.<br>ANSWER: Michelson-Morley experiment<br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q2 2009)<br>This organ is divided into the scala media, scala tympani, and scala vestibuli (ves-TIB-you-lee). Vibrations on the basilar membrane in this structure are transduced into electrical stimuli by this organ's inner hair cells, which are located in the Organ of Corti (CORE-tee). This snail-shaped organ is the primary sense organ of hearing. For 10 points, name this organ also known as the "inner ear."<br>ANSWER: <u>cochlea</u> [or inner ear before mentioned]<br><br>3. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Halton Arp tried unsuccessfully to prove that these objects could be connected by gaseous bridges, and they are distinguished from BL Lac objects because their continuum spectra show unusual emission lines, which were first ex- plained by Maarten Schmidt. These objects reached their peak population in the universe about ten billion years ago, and the first to be discovered was 3C 273, located in the constellation Virgo. These objects operate under the same mechanism as radio galaxies, with their name derived from the fact they are very strong radio sources, though they are now thought to surround the central supermassive black holes of large galaxies. Producing ten to one hundred times more energy than the entire Milky Way in an area the size of our solar system, name these extremely distant objects, the most luminous objects in the universe.<br>ANSWER: quasar [accept quasi-stellar radio source]<br><br>4. Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>The bi-parental type of these objects allows for sublinear search. One type of these objects is composed of several binomial substructures, while another that improves on that kind's runtime is named after Fibonacci. Its minimum or maximum can generally be found in constant time, though most operations on it take log n time. This structure can be used to implement a priority queue, and a process which involves repeatedly removing the root element and then rearranging the structure is the sort named after this structure.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br><strong>The primitive kidney produces retinoic acid, which stimulates this process in females and suppresses it in males. A prolonged resting phase during this process is known as the dictyotene stage, and the Edward and Klinefelter syndromes result from </strong> nondisjunction during it. This process results in oogenesis and spermatogenesis, and this process as a whole evolved from the binary fission of prokaryotes. Resulting in the creation of four haploid daughter cells, for 10 points, name this type of cell division whose second stage is very similar to mitosis.<br>ANSWER: <u>meiosis</u><br><br>10. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>Methadone and Tamoxifen are among the pharmaceuticals produced using these substances, which must be prepared in aprotic solvents. These compounds are often synthesized in a nitrogen atmosphere to avoid water and oxygen, and ethers are some of the few organic molecules these substances will not react with. It took more than fifty years to successfully make one of these substances with fluorine, and their chemical mechanism is based on the reversed polarity of a carbon bond. Consisting of an alkyl or aryl group, a magnesium atom, and a halide, these are commonly used to reduce ketones or aldehydes to alcohols. Added to carbonyl groups to create carbon-carbon bonds, name this class of reagents.<br>ANSWER: Grignard (GRIN-yard) reagent<br><br>11. Science/All (HSAPQ National History Bowl 2011)<br>Notable examples of these items were created by Lydia Pinkham and Clark Stanley. Angostura bitters were originally sold as one of them, and their active ingredients were generally alcohol, cocaine, and heroin rather than the herbs prominently featured in their advertisements.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>This quantity is equal to the opposite of the dot product of the magnetic dipole moment with the magnetic field. It is subtracted in a Lagrangian [la- grahn-zhee-an] but added in a Hamiltonian. In a central inverse square field, it varies inversely with the distance from the center and is generally assigned a negative value. This quantity is only defined for conservative fields, in which it equals the opposite of the integral of force with respect to distance. Its existence is due to the ability of the system to change the work that has been done to it into another form of energy. In a spring, this value is equal to one-half times the spring constant times the displacement squared, and in a uniform gravitational field it is given as mass times gravitational field strength times height.

Science/Biology (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>Glaucophytes are microscopic varieties of these organisms, and a lichen is composed of a fungus and one of them. They are the only type of organism that contains chlorophyll C, which allows them to undergo photosynthesis despite not being plants. Cyanobacteria are sometimes referred to as the "blue-green" type of these organisms, and a red tide is an example of one of their namesake blooms during which they rapidly proliferate.

Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2005)<br>In frogs, this condition can be cured by a pituitary hormone injection, but the condition is usually fatal in plants as chlorophyll is necessary to make food. Affecting about one in every 17,000 humans, it is often characterized by light colored hair, a tendency to squint, and eyes which appear pink. For 10 points, what is this condition caused in humans by an absence of the pigment melanin?<br>ANSWER: <u>albinism</u> or <u>albino</u><br><br>17. Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>With Edouard Goursat, he names a theorem which states that the integral of a complex-valued function on a closed contour in a simply-connected domain is zero. A generalization of his eponymous integral formula is used to define the coefficients of the terms in a Laurent series. With Bernhard Riemann, he is the namesake of two partial differential equations that are necessary and sufficient conditions to prove that a function is analytic. He developed a theory of elasticity that related stress to strain by a 6 by 6 tensor known as the stiffness matrix, effectively generalizing Hooke’s law to three dimensions.

Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>Unlike TCRs, which are formed in a closely related process, they undergo somatic hypermutation. Epitopes bind to these molecules' variable regions by induced fit, and recombinase forms their light chains by deleting sections of DNA to randomly join V, D, and J gene segments. These light chains are joined to heavy ones by disulfide bridges. Their M type can be produced in response to transfusions of a different blood type, while the E type is responsible for allergic reactions. They can cause autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. For 10 points, name these immune system proteins that are produced by B cells in response to antigens.<br>ANSWER: <u>antibodies</u> [or <u>immunoglobins</u>]<br><br>19. Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>A common type of one of these systems is the TAE or TBE type, which both use the molecule Tris along with EDTA. Twelve reagent mixtures selected by Good for use in biological research are these types of systems.

In the first meiotic version of this process, which takes up about ninety percent of the time required for meiosis, synapsis creates tetrads and allows homologous recombination to result in crossing-over at the chiasmata. Because plants lack centrioles, microtubule organizing centers activate during this phase of mitosis. In this phase of mitosis, the nucleolus [*] disintegrates, spindle fibers begin to form asters, sister chromatids attach at centromeres, and chromatin condenses into chromosomes.
