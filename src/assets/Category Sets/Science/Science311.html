Science/All (WUHSAC VIII 2006)<br>In 1936, John Maynard Keynes bought a large collection of Isaac Newton's papers, but was dismayed to find no mention of planetary orbits or gravity, instead finding material on just one subject, one that may explain the unnaturally high concentration of mercury in Newton's hair.

Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>An adult-onset form of this condition is induced by CTG or CCTG repeats, the myotonic form. A milder form of this condition is named for Becker, which, like its best-known form, is X-linked recessive. Its best-known form exhibits Gower's sign, while one aforementioned form results in drooping eyes and difficulty swallowing, and another can require a pacemaker because of its effects on cardiac tissue.

Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XV 2007)<br>|  On Earth, for every 160 meters of altitude, it decreases by one percent, due to the changing of air density. For humans, the world record is 382 miles per hour, achieved by making ones body completely vertical, similar to the way a bird predator dives. Since this value decreases with altitude, falling objects eventually begin to slow down over time. When drag force is equal to gravity, it has been reached. FTP, name this quantity that gives the limit of a speed of a falling object.          |<br>ANSWER: <u>Terminal Velocity</u><br><br>4. Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2010)<br><strong>Independently of Le Bel, this man developed a stereochemical model of the optical activity of certain compounds.  This chemist's name is sometimes appended to Le Chatlier's principle and he used a system of a piston with two semi-permeable membranes to derive an equation for osmotic pressure.
