Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>In nuclear chemistry, this term can refer to a metastable nuclide produced by gamma decay, though the more typi- cal form of this concept can also indicate the inertness of complex ions. Alfred Werner employed this concept to re- place chain theory with coordination theory, and ambident ligands are key to explaining the linkage type of this con- cept. Friedrich Woehler provided the first evidence of this concept by comparing ammonium cyanate and urea, while optical activity is the only means of separting enantiomeric examples like L- and D-glyceraldehyde.

Boltzmann's work led up to this idea, but it was Lord Kelvin who introduced the name for this creature.
