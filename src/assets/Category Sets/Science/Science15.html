1. Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2005)<br>One of Hilbert’s Problems concerns this assertion, which has yet to be proven or disproven; the first serious attempt was by Russell in the Principia Mathematica. Gödel demonstrated in his 1937 proof of Incompleteness Theorem that it could verifiably not be derived from the 9 more conventional Zemerlo­Fraenkel Axioms, nor could any of them be derived from it alone. It is often called Tychonoff’s Theorem or Zorn’s Lemma, especially in the context of its generation of non­integrable functions. For ten points identify thios postulate of set theory which dictates that, in any collection of nonempty sets C, there exists a function f such that one can choose any set S and find f of S to be a member of S.<br>ANSWER: Axiom of Choice (accept Zorn’s Lemma and prompt on Tychonoff’s Theorem (which has to be generalized to be synonymous with AC) before they are mentioned.<br><br>2. Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>This idea was used to demonstrate that auxiliary constraints reduce elasticity in the short run in a work by Paul Samuelson. The theory of response reactions is used to explain inherent violations of this principle, while in commercial synthesis, it is applied to increase [*] yield, as in the case of the Haber-Bosch process. The introduction of a noble gas into a system does not result in changes according to it, while the common-ion effect is a corollary of this principle. For 10 points, identify this principle, which holds that a system at equilibrium will shift to counteract a change in pressure, temperature, volume, or concentration.<br>ANSWER: Le <u>Chatelier's</u> principle<br><br>3. Science/Physics (Maggie Walker GSAC 2013)<br>One problem in modern physics is that this phenomenon cannot be renormalized in quantum field theory, and this interaction is carried by a spin-2 gauge boson. Particles only affected by this force move along geodesics due to its equivalence principle, and a constant associated with this force was measured with a torsion balance in the Cavendish experiment. In general relativity, this force results from the curvature of spacetime, and it is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between two bodies. For 10 points, name this force that causes an acceleration of about 9.81 meters per second squared on Earth, first described by Isaac Newton.<br>ANSWER: Gravity [accept equivalents such as Gravitational Force]<br><br>4. Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>Malic acid is used as a catalyst for this because it consumes pyruvic acid without building up lactic acid.  It consists of a series of 8 reactions, and, in the first, carbon atoms enter as acetyl-CoA, and the last reaction results in the regeneration of oxaloacetate.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2010)<br>Some types of this device exhibit negative resistance at higher voltages. Their current varies exponentially according to the Shockley equation, and four of them make up a bridge rectifier. One type achieves rapid switching by replacing a p-type semiconductor with a metal contact, while another type allows for reverse bias operation because of its reduced breakdown voltage; those are the Schottky and Zener types. Consisting of a PN-junction, they allow current to pass in only one direction. For 10 points, name these circuit components, one type of which is "light-emitting."<br>ANSWER: diodes <LC><br><br>7.

Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>It is held constant in throttling processes, and the Born-Haber process measures one of these associated with a crystal lattice. It is commonly written as the sum of the system's internal energy with the product of its pressure and volume, and for constant-pressure processes, the change in this quantity may be written as work.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>An important medical application of this theory is the use of tetracycline to inhibit the apicoplast of Plasmodium parasites. The nucleomorph inside cryptomonad algae is taken as proof for this theory, which opposes the endogenous hypothesis. One controversial application of this theory explains the 9 plus 2 arrangement of microtubules in flagella and cilia, and the best molecular evidence for it comes from the small ribosomal subunit.
