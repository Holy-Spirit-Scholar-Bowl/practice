This region is located beneath the cerebral cortex and behind the pons, and damage to this part of the brain results in uncoordinated or incorrectly timed motions.

Science/All (JAMES 2013)<br><strong>Compared to other types of this procedure, one type of it performs better the closer it is to completion, scaling from big O of N squared to big O of N . The shell type of this procedure improves on that previous insertion type. The last element of the partition is sometimes chosen as the </strong> pivot position in a type of this procedure that uses a "divide-and-conquer" and recursive algorithm; that type is named for its speed. One of these procedures allows elements to "rise" to the top by comparing them and appropriately swapping them based on their values.

Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>At large values, this function can be approximated with the Lanczos approximation, an alternative for the Stirling approximation. This function, equal to the square root of pi at one half*, is defined as the integral from zero to infinity of t to the power of z minus one times e to the negative t. This function is not defined for non-positive integers and is noted for the fact that this function’s value at z plus one is equal to z times this functions value at z, allowing it to be defined recursively.

Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>Grignard reagents cannot form without the presence of one of these compounds, and tetrahydrofuran is a cyclic version of one of them. Oxonium compounds are formed when they react with strong inorganic or Lewis acids, and oxidation of them results in an unstable peroxide, and they can be formed dehydration of an alcohol or catalytic hydration of an olefin.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>The unit cell volume of a single silicon crystal figures into a popular calculation to determine the value of this constant. This constant was originally discovered by Johann Loschmidt, who, for his efforts, names the number density of particles instead.

In its most typical form, it results in a Ghon focus, which may spread to the lymph nodes or the heart, the latter causing the miliary (MI- lee-ehr-ee) form of this disease. The BCG vaccine for it, invented in 1921, gained widespread acceptance after World War II; now, it is not used regularly in the U.S. but is in most other countries.

Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2004)<br>Richard Hare developed a two level version of this theory from the Kant- like principle of universalizability. Henry Sidgwick, often cited as one of its advocates, reconciled it with intuitionism but not egoism. Critics argue that is commits the naturalist fallacy and that it is too demanding, because it seems to require supererogatory action. A form of consequentalism, its “rule” version is generally less controversial than its “act” version. For ten points, identify the moral theory that was advocated by Jeremy Bentham and J.S. Mill and that aims to produce the greatest happiness.<br>ANSWER: <u>Utilitarianism</u><br><br>16.
