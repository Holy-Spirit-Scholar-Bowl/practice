1. Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>This quantity is measured along with volume on a Gran plot, and one device for measuring this quantity was developed by Arnold Orville Beckman. An analogue of this value is used to determine potential in an electrochemical cell in the Nernst equation, and a related value to this quantity, alkalinity, is derived from it and measures the concentration of hydroxide ions in a solution. For a high value of this quantity, phenolphthalein will turn pink, indicating the presence of a base, and it is calculated using the negative log of the concentration of hydrogen ions. For 10 points, name this chemical quantity that runs from values of 0 to 14, used to indicate acidity.<br>ANSWER: <u>pH</u><br><br>2. Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>The Herfindahl index for these occurrences is equal to ten thousand, and this word describes a type of competition in which all goods are slightly differentiated. The natural type of these entities can arise due to increasing returns to scale caused by high fixed costs, and their revenues are maximized where the price elasticity of demand equals one. By engaging in </strong> price discrimination, they can reduce the amount of deadweight loss, and they generally produce fewer goods at higher prices than perfectly competitive industries. For ten points, identify these markets in which there is only one producer.<br>ANSWER: <u>monopoli</u>es (accept word forms like <u>monopoli</u>stic)<br><br>3. Science/Math (LIST 2014)<br><strong>This property's namesake operators are applied in Kuratowski's axioms. According to the Heine-Borel theorem, a set is compact if it is both bounded and this, which means it contains all of its limit points. The Cantor set, despite containing only boundary points and lacking density, has this property. Because multiplying any two integers yields another integer, the set of </strong> integers satisfies this property under multiplication. Intervals with this property include their end values and are denoted with square brackets, unlike their complement which uses parentheses. For ten points, identify this property in set theory contrasted with open.<br>ANSWER: closed sets/intervals [accept word forms like closure operators]<br><br>4. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>One measure of the power of this structure is price minus marginal cost all over price, called the Lerner Index. It has a Herfindahl-Hirschman index of 10,000, and its pricing is determined by the inverse elasticity rule. A low, nearly constant marginal cost and high fixed costs are conducive to the natural type of this system. It may produce at fair-return or socially optimal prices, which are less than the profit maximizing price. It lacks a supply curve, so profit is maximized when half of linear revenue, or marginal revenue, equals marginal cost. For 10 points, name this market structure in which a single producer dominates.<br>ANSWER: <u>monopoly</u> [accept word forms; do not accept “monopolistic competition”]<br><br>5. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>Leslie Orgel replicated the results of this study at freezing temperatures, while Michael Robertson’s version gave evidence for the RNA world hypothesis. A variation conducted by Joan (hoh-AHN) Oró produced adenine (AA-duh-neen) when hydrogen cyanide (SAI-uh-naid) was included as a starting material, and criticism of this experiment points to its disregard of UV radiation and lack of volcanic sulfur compounds in the air. A recent analysis of the results found more than four times the amino acid products than originally reported. Using an electric spark to simulate lightning on a heated mixture of water, hydrogen, ammonia, and methane, name this experiment that showed abiotic (ay-bai-AH-tic) synthesis of organic molecules was possible in Earth’s early atmosphere.<br>ANSWER: Miller-Urey experiment [or Urey-Miller experiment]<br><br>6. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>This mathematician proposed a problem which became the first of Hilbert's problems and is known as the con- tinuum hypothesis. This mathematician developed the concept of numbers that are larger than all finite numbers but not necessarily infinite, which he called transfinite numbers; and his eponymous fractal is created by taking the closed interval zero, one and repeatedly deleting open middle thirds. This mathematician attempted to write every number in its binary representation but derived a contradiction to show that the set of reals is uncountable—his namesake di- agonal argument. Name this German founder of set theory.<br>ANSWER: Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp <u>Cantor</u><br><br>7. Science/All (QuAC I 2008)<br>The man who lends his name to this also named an alternative to the Third Law of the Thermodynamics, his “Heat Theorem”. One form of it sums outward and inward-flowing species on a cell membrane based on charge, also known as the Goldman equation. Other terms in this equation include the constant RT/F, with F being Faraday's constant, and it is used the ratio of equilibrium ionic concentrations to determine reduction potentials.

Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>One type of this procedure is a triply-eponymous method that counts how many times somebody from a stronger sample beats somebody from a weaker sample, quantified as capital U. In addition to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney type, the Wald type of this procedure determines whether or not a parameter exists, and the Yates type corrects the Pearson chi-square type, which, like the type that uses the Student's t-distribution, requires finding the degrees of freedom to calculate the p-value necessary to reject the null hypothesis. Give the name common to these procedures which determine whether or not a result is statistically significant.<br>ANSWER: statistical hypothesis <u>testing</u> of <u>significance</u><br><br>9. Science/Other (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>The oldest solids formed in the solar system are inclusions enriched in calcium and this metal in chondrite meteorites. It's not magnesium, but one isotope of it has a 0.73-million-year half-life and is used as a clock for early solar system events. With clay and iron, this metal is leached from the E horizon. Except for quartz, all tectosilicates contain this element. Corundum is a crystalline form of this element's oxide. Along with silicon, oxygen, calcium, and alkalis, this metal is found in a mineral that comes in orthoclase and plagioclase types and is the </strong> most common rock-forming mineral in the crust; that mineral is feldspar.

Several of them linked in series are called paternoster, and cirques in a glacier cirques can form a type of these called a tarn. Cutting a bend from a meandering river will form the oxbow variety of these, and ones located on volcanoes are the crater type. For 10 points, name these inland bodies of water, of which a set of five "Great" ones lie on the American-Canadian border.<br>ANSWER: Lakes<br><br>11. Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>The "jaws of a vise" theory was used to describe this process in the 1850s, implying that the squeezing of rocks was the main force behind it. There are three types of belts that stem from this process; the hercynotype variety usually results in island arcs, and is responsible for the separation of Japan from the Asian continent. Due to these events, most of the rock formations that are raised to the crust have undergone metamorphism, and over time, erosion slowly brings these to the surface. The most famous example of this process in action being the Himalayas, FTP, name this event that results in the creation of mountains due to plate tectonics.<br>ANSWER: <u>Orogeny</u><br><br>12.

Science/All (NTV 2009)<br>In combination with the London equation, this law can be used to find the penetration depth in the Meissner effect. Its original form implied that the magnetic field was solenoidal. It can also be expressed as “the curl of the H-field equals the conduction current”, and for static fields, this law is equivalent to the Biot-Savart law. Its original form was incompatible with capacitors, so Maxwell added a term of the time-derivative of the E-field, the displacement current, to this equation. This law states that the free current is proportional to the path integral of magnetic field with respect to displacement. Used to find the magnetic field produced by a wire, name this one of Maxwell's equations, named for a French physicist.<br>ANSWER: <u>Ampère's</u> Circuit Law [or the <u>Ampère</u>-<u>Maxwell</u> Law]<br><br>15.
