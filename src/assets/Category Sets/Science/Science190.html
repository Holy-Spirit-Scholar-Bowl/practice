Science/All (From Here To Eternity 2009)<br>Used as evidence for the special theory of relativity, it involved looking for fringes of light separated by dark stripes.  In order to maximize the shift, the experiment was repeated, increasing the length of the beams by repeated reflections.  In it, a beam of light was split by a reflecting mirror into two perpendicular beams, then reflected back to the source and recombined.  The apparatus was rotated in such a way that the interference pattern would have changed if the light was traveling through ether, but this proved not to be the case.

Science/Math (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>For finite difference methods applied to PDEs, this property is equivalent to stability according to the Lax equivalence theorem. The Weierstrass M-test can be used to test for this property. A sequence of real numbers has this property if and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. For a series with both positive and negative terms, the </strong> "absolute" form of this property is stronger than the usual form, only requiring that the terms go to zero.
