Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>Thing bound for this organelle are enclosed in COPI (COPE-one) or COPII (COPE-two). Proteoglycans are formed here via glycosylation. It is divided into cis, medial, and trans compartments, and in this organelle, mannose-6-phosphate is </strong> added to proteins destined for the lysosome.

Science/Other (BELLOCO 2014)<br>The sea level highstand during the mid-Cretaceous period can be attributed to this process's namesake pulse. The Vine-Matthews-Morley hypothesis states that this process causes evidence for Earth's reversing magnetic field through the appearance of alternating stripes in polarized rock. Robert Dietz's model of this process assumed that a sliding surface was present at the base of the lithosphere. This process was first described by Harry Hess, and it is caused by the asthenosphere's convection currents, which propel basaltic magma to the Earth's surface. For 10 points, name this process responsible for continental drift that creates new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges.<br>ANSWER: seafloor spreading [prompt on "continental drift" before mentioned]<br><br>4. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 16 2011)<br><strong>One section of these materials is known as the depletion zone. These materials are characterized by a small gap between the Fermi level and the valence band. Impurities are added to these materials in order to create either extra electrons or electron holes in the N- and P-types of these materials, respectively. That process is called </strong> doping. These materials, such as germanium and gallium arsenide, are used in electronic devices such as diodes and transistors.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2005)<br>In the so-called “Delta E effect,” it is induced by elastic tension, and the Fleming-Kennelly law states that the reluctivity of a substance with this property varies linearly with field strength at certain points. Heisenberg’s theory of it assumes that parallel electron spins are favored and Ewing’s theory of it assumes that each atom can turn freely about its center, though Weiss’s theory is more generally accepted today.

Science/Biology (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>It's not the Tragedy of the Commons, but Garrett Hardin promoted the cultural variety of this value. This value appears in the denominator of both the Verhulst-Pearl and competitive Lotka-Volterra equations to study predator- prey relationships, as it explains the necessity of both adequate amounts of predators and prey.

This concept is generalized as geodesics in metric spaces, and the polar plot "r equals secant theta" is one of these. One of these constructs called a directrix is used in conjunction with the focus to define a parabola. </strong> Non-intersecting ones in different planes are skew, while two that intersect at 90 degrees are classified as perpendicular.
