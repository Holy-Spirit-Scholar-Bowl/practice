Science/Physics (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>These particles are created by the breaking of a G gauge group's symmetry in a model developed by 't Hooft and Polyakov, and they are equivalent to a dyon with no charge. The first solution to the Yang-Mills field equation was one of these entities named for Wu and Yang. Before joining CDMS, Blas Cabrera used a SQUID to observe one of these particles on Valentine's Day, 1982. The </strong> MoEDAL experiment at the LHC looks for these particles. These particles are produced in large quantities at the GUT scale, but inflation explains why their density is low.

Science/Physics (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>Canal ray tubes were used to investigate a form of this phenomenon predicted by special relativity in the Ives-Stillwell experiment.

Anvil heads form at the upper boundary of this region, and the three-cell model, which consists of Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, explains circulation within it. This region has grown in recent decades, a trend blamed on ozone depletion and greenhouse gases.

Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>Electromagnetic signal from this phenomenon can be related temperature by the Sakuma-Hattori equation. One law describing this phenomenon states that the peak wavelength of it is inversely proportional to temperature. Another law that governs it states that intensity is a function of temperature to the fourth power. In addition to Wien’s displacement law, another law governing this type of radiation was derived by finding the number of moves for standing waves in a cubical cavity. That law, the Rayleigh-Jeans law, experiences an ultraviolet catastrophe, which can be avoided by using Planck’s law to describe this type of radiation.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>This equation was derived in a work that gave the first visualization of the Carnot [kar-NOH] cycle   and an early version of the ideal gas law. Its first derivation was correct because it applies to a  situation in which heat change equals enthalpy change. In one version of this equation, temperature   squared is multiplied by the ideal gas constant, while in another version temperature is multiplied by  specific volume change. Both versions can be used to find the derivative of pressure with respect to  temperature.
