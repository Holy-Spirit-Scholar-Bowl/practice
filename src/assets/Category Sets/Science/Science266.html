This is the shape of an orbit for an object at the moment it reaches, but does not exceed, the escape velocity. Because of the ability of this shape to focus light on a point, it is the proposed shape for Archimedes “death ray”. For 10 points, identify this conic section with an eccentricity of exactly one, defined as the set of points on a plane equidistant from a line called the directrix and a point called a focus which is exemplified by the graph of the equation y equals x squared.<br>ANSWER: <u>parabola</u><br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 2 2008)<br>Rh antigens regulate the movement of both carbon dioxide and this substance in and out of red blood cells. Production of this compound in some bacteria requires the proteins molybdoferredoxin and azoferredoxin. The anhydrous form of this substance is often stolen, as it is a critical ingredient for the production of methamphetamines, and it is often used in fertilizers. This input to the Ostwald process is industrially produced by the Haber-Bosch process.

Science/All (SCOP Novice 2010)<br><strong>Ordinary companion cells in this tissue collect solutes by apoplastic transfers and have plasmodesmata connections almost exclusively with the sieve tubes. This layer is wedged behind the sclerenchyma, and is the last layer removed when girdling.

Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>The condition's appearance depends on Virchow's triad, a group of three factors known to affect clot formation. Paget-Schrötter disease can result when blood vessels in the arm are involved instead of those in the region of the body it usually targets. Low molecular weight Heparin is administered on a regular basis via intramuscular injection, often into the thigh, to bedridden patients and those who have recently had surgery to reduce the risk of this condition. If left untreated, it can lead to a fatal pulmonary embolus if the clots involved affecting circulation in the leg or pelvis become dislodged.

Science/Computer Science (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>A two-dimensional variant of this model found in the game of life is known as Langton's ant. Savitch's theorem guarantees that adding non-determinism to these entities does not improve their ability to save space. For partial functions, Rice's theorem states that these items cannot find their non-trivial properties in a finite amount of time. Their namesake showed that the halting problem for them is undecidable.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2010)<br>The Gram-Schmidt process applies a series of projections to these objects. A certain operation on three of these gives the volume of a parallelepiped. One operation on these objects is anti-commutative, and two of these are orthogonal if another operation yields zero; those operations are the cross and dot products. Sometimes written as a one-column matrix, the sum of two of these can be represented as the diagonal of a parallelogram.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>One phenomenon that happens under this condition occurs in the presence of two narrowly separated metal plates; it is characterized by a force proportional to the negative fourth power of their separation. A difference between the energy of the 2s and 2p energy levels owes to the interaction between electrons and this entity. The </strong> Casimir effect and the Lamb shift arise due to the properties of this condition, which was used by the Newcomen steam engine to drive a piston. In Gaussian units, permittivity and permeability are both one at this condition. For 10 points, name this phenomenon where a volume of space contains very little matter.<br>ANSWER: vacuum<br><br>8. Science/All (PACE NSC 2008)<br>In 1987, Lieb and Yau proposed an analog of this for boson-composed stars such as axion stars, using a Hartree-type equation instead of the namesake's. As a consequence of it, main sequence stars larger than eight solar masses must become neutron stars or black holes. The value for it is thought to be around 1.4 solar masses or 2.96x1030 [2.96 times 10 to the 30th] kilograms, and no white dwarf can be stabilized by degeneracy pressure beyond it.

Often the site of mounds called pingos, it is formed by a process known as pergelation. Estimated to comprise around twenty percent of the world’s land surface, it can maintain its integrity if it is composed of well-drained, coarse-grained sediments as opposed to finer-grained soil with lots of ice.

Sometimes also named for Lo Surdo is the splitting of spectral lines by one of these, the Stark effect. The permittivity of free space times the susceptibility cross this quantity gives the polarization. The curl of this quantity is equal to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field by Faraday's law of induction. The magnitude of this is given by an inverse square law named for Coulomb.

Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament 2010)<br>Unfamiliar “hyper” forms of this phenomenon help explain apparent violations of the octet rule and are given designations like tau and nu. The theory of these entities was described by Linus Pauling in a classic work. One specific type of these entities forces substituents to remain planar; that type results from overlapping p orbitals and is denoted “pi.” These entities are classified as “polar” or “nonpolar” based on the relative electronegativity of the atoms involved.

Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>One of the main actions of this hormone is described by the acid growth hypothesis. By activating proton pumps in the cell membrane, this hormone causes the pH of the cell wall to decrease, ultimately making it more elastic. They also can induce ethylene synthesis in high concentrations and inhibit senescene and abscission. Indole-3-acetic acid is the prominent example of this group of hormones, which help ensure that the main stem of the plant grows the most by inhibiting development of the lateral buds.
