Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Molecules undergoing this process may be surrounded by a complex formed by the barrel-shaped GroEL (grow-E-L) and lid-shaped GroES (grow-E-S). The rate of this process's "co-translational" form can be controlled by swapping synonymous codons for each other. Molten globules are theorized to exist partway down the energy funnel modelling this process. Christian </strong> Anfinsen believed it was controlled entirely by the amino acid sequence. This process sometimes regulated by chaperonins (CHAPERONE-ins) turns denatured polypeptides (poly-PEP-tides) into their native states by minimizing contact between hydrophobic regions and water.
