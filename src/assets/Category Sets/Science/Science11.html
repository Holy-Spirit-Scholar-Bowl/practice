1. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>Members of this genus are often grown on bismuth sulfite agar, and are tested for in the TSI slant test, which detects their hydrogen sulfide waste products. These rod-shaped Gram-negative bacteria are related to genus Shigella, and they can infect the lamina propria, causing gastroenteritis. These bacteria cause typhoid fever, and can be killed by heating for 10 minutes at 75 degrees Celsius. For 10 points, name this genus of bacteria responsible for food poisoning, found in raw meat and poultry.<br>ANSWER: <u>Salmonella</u> bacteria<br><br>2. Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>This operation can be performed nowhere on the Weierstrass function, and L'Hopital's rule uses this function to evaluate limits of indeterminate forms. If this operation can be performed, the function must be continuous, though the converse does not hold. The </strong> chain rule is useful for performing this operation on composite functions, and Leibniz' notation for it is written as d y over d x. For 10 points, name this measure of the instantaneous rate of change of a function, often represented by the slope of a tangent line.<br>ANSWER: <u>derivative</u> [or <u>differentiation</u>]<br><br>3. Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>Abnormal levels of chemicals produced by this organ can result in Sheehan’s syndrome and diabetes insipidus. In  embryos, part of this structure forms from a depression in the roof of the mouth called Rathke’s Pouch. This organ is separated into the neurohypophysis and the adenohypophysis, the latter of which produces endorphins in addition to gonadotropins like luteinizing hormone and </strong> follicle-stimulating hormone. Childbirth and breastfeeding are regulated by the oxytocin produced by the posterior lobe of this gland. Antidiuretic hormone and growth hormone are secreted by, for ten points, what “master” endocrine gland situated below the hypothalamus?<br>ANSWER: <u>pituitary</u> gland (accept <u>hypophysis</u> before “neurohypophysis” is mentioned”)<br><br>4. Science/All (NTV 2009)<br>This value is often determined experimentally by finding the reaction rate at different temperatures, then plotting the logarithm of the rate constant against the reciprocal of temperature and finding the slope of the line of best fit. A relatively low value of this indicates that a greater proportion of colliding reactants will result in reactions. It appears in the numerator of the exponent of the Arrhenius equation, and catalysts work by lowering this value for particular reactions. Name this value denoted as E-sub-A, that measures the minimum energy needed for a reaction to occur.<br>ANSWER: <u>activation</u> energy [accept <u>E</u>-<u>sub</u>-<u>A</u> before it is mentioned]<br><br>5. Science/Math (Masonic 2014)<br>This shape consists of all the points in spherical coordinates for which rho goes from zero to a constant times cosine phi, and phi goes from zero to a constant less than pi over two. Spheres tangent to one of these and a plane are called Dandelin spheres. In cylindrical coordinates, the equation z equals r gives one of these shapes. Name this shape whose slices are used to generate ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, and which has a volume equal to one-third pi times r squared times h.<br>ANSWER: cones (accept double cone or conic)<br><br>6. Science/All (WUHSAC IX 2007)<br>Some would look at the Gateway Arch, and quickly dismiss it as a parabola. But the equation of a parabola does not describe the Arch. In fact, the Arch is the upside-down version of what you would get if you hung a chain by its endpoints. For ten points, what is the proper term for the shape of the Gateway Arch, a curve that mimics the hyperbolic cosine function?<br>ANSWER: inverted <u>catenary</u> (accept “<u>hyperbolic cosine</u> function” before said)<br><br>7. Science/Other (SCOP Novice 2013)<br><strong>A concentration of iridium corresponds to one of these events that took place at the K-T boundary, and which was likely due to the Chicxulub [CHEEK-shoo-loob] impact. The coelacanth [SEE-lih-kant] is an example of a Lazarus taxon which experiences this event but then reappears in the fossil record. More recently, this event occurred to the </strong> passenger pigeon and dodo. Dinosaurs experienced this about 65 million years ago. For 10 points, name this event in which an entire species dies.<br>ANSWER: (mass) extinction event(s) (prompt on dying or similar answers; accept asteroid impact or logical equivalent until "Chicxulub" is read)<br><br>8. Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>The mobile phase of HPLC may be optimized using an index named for Snider and this property. Amphipathic molecules typically have one group with this property and one without. A molecule acquires this property by possessing an uneven charge distribution, leading to an electric dipole, which owes to differences in electronegativity; that is why water, but not methane, possesses this property. For 10 points, give this term which, when applied to a chemical bond, refers to the degree to which electrons are equally shared.<br>ANSWER: <u>polarity</u> [accept word forms]<br><br>9. Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>Members of this taxonomic group lack teeth except as infants and have the ability to sense electric fields using receptors in their snouts. They lack a corpus callosum but have a cloaca, through which oviparous birth occurs. Males have horny spurs on their rear ankles that are sometimes venomous. Females have glands on their abdomens which secrete milk, instead of having nipples. They live only in Australia and New Guinea, and have bones in their jaws and ears marking them as mammals, despite contention. Comprising their class along with Metatheria and Eutheria, for 10 points, name this order of egg-laying mammals which includes platypuses and echidnas.<br>ANSWER: <u>monotremata</u> [or <u>monotremes</u>]<br><br>10. Science/Math (PACE NSC 2015)<br><strong>Using Knuth's notation, this number can be written as 2, followed by 5 up arrows, followed by another 2. For a set of this many mutually tangent circles, Descartes' theorem gives the radius of one of them given the rest. The only case of Fermat's last theorem actually proved by Fermat is when n equals this number. This is the smallest number of elements in a non-cyclic group; that group is named for Felix </strong> Klein. This is the largest degree of polynomials for which there is a general solution, by the Abel-Ruffini theorem. Appel and Haken were assisted by a computer in proving that only this many colors were needed to color a map. This is the smallest number of vertices a Platonic solid can have.

Science/All (Brookwood Invitational Scholars Bowl 2013)<br>In the Gospel of Luke, Luke uses the word “kataphileo” to describe one instance of this action. During the Hajj, a Muslim may point towards the Black Stone and recite “In the name of God, God is great” if they are unable to do this action at the Black Stone of the Kaaba. Whenever entering a room, Jews do this action to the mezuzah. The father of the Prodigal Son did this action to his son upon the son’s return. In return for thirty pieces of silver, one person agreed to do this to his master in the Garden of Gethsemane. For 10 points, name this action, the ironic way in which Judas betrayed Jesus.<br>ANSWER: <u>kiss</u> [accept word forms; prompt on general answers like “touch”]<br><br>12. Science/Biology (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2014)<br><strong>Goatsbeard plants of the genus Tragopogon are a model for one form of this process, which involves the formation of autopolyploid and allopolyploid organisms. Prezygotic and postzygotic barriers facilitate this process, one theory of which involves cladogenesis and is contrasted with phyletic </strong> gradualism; Stephen Jay Gould helped develop that theory, called punctuated equilibrium. The sympatric and allopatric types of this phenomenon differ based on whether geographic barriers contribute to reproductive isolation. For ten points, name this process which results in the formation of new species.<br>ANSWER: speciation [accept specific types, such as allopatric, peripatric, sympatric, or parapatric speciation; prompt on "evolution"]<br><br>13. Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>One sequence of polynomials with this property begins one, then x, then three-halves x squared minus one half; the integral of any product of two of those from negative one to one equals zero. This term also refers to a specializa- tion of unitary matrices, namely, matrices whose transposes equal their inverses. A set with this property can be pro- duced by recursively subtracting vector projections; that is a basis produced by the Gram-Schmidt process. This term also describes vectors whose inner product, or dot product, is zero; as well as two lines whose slopes are opposite re- ciprocals. Give this property which applies to adjacent sides of a rectangle.<br>ANSWER: <u>orthogonality</u> [accept <u>perpendicularity</u>; accept <u>normality</u>; accept word forms of any of the answer<br><br>14. Science/Physics (NTSS 2013)<br>This type of motion impacts climate by creating Milankovitch [mee-lahn-KOE-vich] Cycles. The axial type of this motion causes a Platonic [plah-TAH-nik] Year, which for Earth is almost twenty-six thousand times longer than a standard year. The apsidal [AP-si-dul] type of this motion is the change of an orbital path, and the theory of general relativity explained this type motion by the planet Mercury. Also observed in everyday objects, this motion can be explained by the conservation of angular momentum when a force acts at an angle to spinning motion. Name this motion seen in gyroscopes when there is rotation of a rotating axis.<br>ANSWER: precession<br><br>15. Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament VII 2012)<br>The lack of externally visible genitalia in this organism led to the naming of its Ken and Barbie genes, and maternal effect genes involved in directing its anterior-posterior axis include bicoid  and hunchback. Mutations in the Antennapedia gene result in the growth of legs from the eyes in this organism and bithorax  is another possible mutation. Hybrid dysgenesis works through the P element common in wild type individuals, while phenotypes include cinnabar, sepia, and white eyes.

Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>In one term appearing in the general form of the Navier-Stokes equation, the gradient of pressure is divided by this other physical property. The two elements of the periodic table with the highest value of this property are iridium and osmium, and this property is lower in ice than in liquid water. In equations, it is represented by the lowercase Greek letter rho, and for a given substance, the ratio of this property to that of water is called specific gravity. For 10 points, identify this physical property, defined as the mass of an object divided by its volume.<br>ANSWER: Density [prompt on “rho” before mentioned]<br><br>19. Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>A mutation of the FMR1 gene can result in Martin-Bell syndrome, also named for the “fragile” form of this structure. These are inactivated in females in a process called lyonization, resulting in the formation of Barr bodies.  Klinefelter syndrome sees the presence of one or more extra copies of this chromosome in males, resulting in reduced levels of testosterone. Turner syndrome is a condition in which females may only have one of these chromosomes. For 10 points, identify this sex chromosome that is present in both males and females.<br>ANSWER: X chromosome<br><br>20. Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>The motion of a magnetic moment about a magnetic field, common in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is the Larmor type of this phenomenon. While one form of it, which may be visualized with Poinsot's construction, occurs when an object is close to a maximum or minimum principal axis, and this phenomenon is called "gyroscopic" when torque-induced. This motion is described by the change in the first Euler angle and its pure form occurs in the absence of nutation.
