The overlap of peaks in this procedure is measured by resolution, and each component has a unique ratio of two concentrations called a partition coefficient.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>The formation of these entities has been linked to the Madden-Julian oscillation and Rossby waves. Two of these approach each other and eventually merge in the Fujiwara effect. Often re-curving around the subtropical ridge, their activity peaks in late summer. Reaching a 12 on the Beaufort scale, they rarely form near the equator because the Coriolis force there is too weak to make them spin.

Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>One feature of this type is carved from existing bedrock by a glacier, has a smooth upper portion and a craggy bottom portion, and is known as a sheepback. Another feature of this type is often found in conjunction with kettle lakes and occurs when a melting glacier retreats; those are termed kames. Tear- shaped ones are formed when a glacier deposits a large rock and sediment builds up behind it, and are called drumlins.

Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>In nature, this element is prevalent in gypsum and dolomite, as well as a namesake birefringent mineral that marks the 3 on Mohs hardness scale. Its presence in biological cells can lead to the formation of inositol tri-phosphate and di-acyl-glycerol, and its influx into axons causes release of neuro-transmitters.

Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>With Thomas Hertog, this physicist suggested top-down cosmology as a way to address the anthropic principle. With Jim Hartle, this physicist suggested that the universe, despite being finite, has no spacetime boundary. The association of a temperature with every solution of the Einstein field equations that contains a causal horizon is named for him and for Gibbons.

Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>Charged examples of these objects exhibit an internal boundary named for Cauchy and satisfy the Reissner-Nordstrom metric. A photon sphere can occur near one of these, and the Penrose process seeks to extract energy from their ergospheres. The Lense-Thirring effect describes the frame-dragging produced by a rotating one of these objects subject to the no-hair theorem. Spontaneous pair production results in their emission of Hawking radiation, and the Schwarzchild radius is the distance from the center at which the event horizon occurs.
