Science/All (MOHIT (Thomas Jefferson) 2009)<br>For a particle, the orbital form of this quantity is defined by its azimuthal quantum number. The conservation of this property is related to the rotational symmetry of space. Defined as the Gibbs vector product of an object's position and linear momentum vectors, this quantity is also equivalent to the cross product of an object's moment of inertia and its angular velocity.

Science/Biology (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>The sd-1 "green revolution" rice mutant has a defect in the production of these hormones. The synthesis of these compounds requires the cyclization of geranylgeranyl disphosphate to kaurene. These hormones facilitate the action of PIFs during the etiolation response by triggering the degradation of DELLA proteins. They were originally discovered due to fungal infections in rice causing chlorosis, a condition called </strong> foolish seedling disease or bakanae.
