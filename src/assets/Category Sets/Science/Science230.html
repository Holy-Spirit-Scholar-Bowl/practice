This person's name is associated with NGC 2261, a variable nebula he observed when he became the first person to look through the Hale Telescope. His tuning-fork diagram separates spiral from barred spiral galaxies, and he showed that Andromeda was not a nebula, but a separate galaxy outside the Milky Way. An approximate age of the universe is given by the inverse of this man's namesake constant, which also appears in his law stating that the velocity of objects receding from the Earth is proportional to their distance; a fact he established by observing the red- shift of galaxies.

Canal ray tubes were used by Ives and Stilwell to investigate the transverse version of this effect. The introduction of the Lorentz factor as the inverse of the square root of one minus the ratio of the velocity of the source and the speed of light allows for the calculation of the relativistic form of this effect, which can be used to measure the radial velocity of galaxies with blueshift and redshift.
