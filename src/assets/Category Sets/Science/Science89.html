1. Science/Physics (SCOP Novice 2014)<br><strong>Calculations in this theory can be simplified in a manifold named for Minkowski. This theory includes the "pole in the barn" and "twin" paradoxes, and it predicts length contraction and time dilation.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br><strong>The splitting of spectral lines by one of these is known as the Stark effect.

Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 11 2009)<br><strong>Allred and Rochow (ROE-shou) developed one formula to calculate this property, which can also be calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of electronic affinity and </strong> ionization energy in the Mulliken scale. The most commonly used scale for this property, developed by Linus Pauling, gives fluorine a value of just under 4.0.

Science/All (Illinois Earlybird 2006)<br>Pencil and Paper Ready. Scott is playing dice in a back alley. If he wins, he gains four dollars; otherwise, he loses two dollars. Each game has a one-fourth probability that Scott will win and he loses otherwise. If Scott plays ten games, how much money will he gain or lose on average? Note that, since each game is an independent event, we can simply calculate the expected value for one game and multiply it by ten and that expected value is simply the probability times the payout summed over all possible payouts; thus each game has an expected loss of 25 cents. FTP, state Scott's expected value for playing ten games?<br>ANSWER: lose 5 dollars (accept negative 5 dollars)<br><br>5. Science/All (SASS 2013)<br>NGC 3582 is of interest to astronomers due to the presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which could lead to the emergence of this. The Gosper glider gun was the first pattern to grow indefinitely in a game named after this, which is the most notable cellular automaton. The Miller-Urey experiment proved that spontaneous abiogenesis is a viable theory for the emergence of this, while viruses are generally not considered a form of this due to their need for host cells and lack of metabolism. SETI searches for intelligent forms of this. Identify this characteristic which ceases upon death.<br>ANSWER: <u>life</u><br><br>6. Science/All (PACE NSC 2008)<br>Landau proposed that excitations in these propagate via “rotons,” and glitches are thought to occur in pulsars when neutrons turn into these, explaining their unusual vorticity. They can also form Rollin films, which exhibit the Onnes effect, wherein capillary forces acting on them are greater than gravity, and they have infinite thermal conductivity. Occurring below the lambda point for helium, for 10 points, identify this property exhibited by a liquid which has zero viscosity.<br>ANSWER: <u>superfluid</u> [or <u>superfluidity</u>]<br><br>7. Science/Chemistry (BELLOCO 2014)<br>An intermediate of this type is formed on a carbon chain during E1 and SN1 reactions. That intermediate is carbenium and assumes an sp2 hybridized state. A molecular example of this chemical species is arenium, which is stabilized by pi bond delocalization. Coordination complexes occur when ligands bind to these entities. Metals in aqueous solutions usually form these chemical species, which tend to have smaller atomic radii than their neutral or oppositely-charged counterparts because of these species' relative lack of electrons. A hydrogen form of this type of species is a bare proton.
