Science/All (BATE 2010)<br>This phenomenon causes a noise called the Barkhausen effect; that noise is the result of the rapid shifting of domains. This phenomenon is mathematically described by the Ising model and is achieved in materials that have small localized domains where the electrons all possess the same spin. The core of a transformer is composed of a material possessing this property. This property disappears above a certain point called the Curie temperature and is the result when an externally applied magnetic field causes electrons to align in the same direction.
