The Kerr metric is used for the spinning ones of these, while the Schwarzschild metric describes the non-spinning, uncharged ones. These objects, which usually form when gravitational force overcomes degeneracy pressure, can be completely characterized by their mass, charge, and spin, according to the no-hair theorem. The cosmic censorship hypothesis claims that these must always have event horizons to prevent their singularities from being visible.
