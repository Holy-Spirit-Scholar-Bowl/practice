1. Science/Physics (SCOP Novice 2011)<br><strong>Noether's theorem relates this quantity to rotational symmetry. The no-hair theorem states that black holes can be characterized entirely by their mass, their charge, and their value of this quantity, which leads to </strong> Kepler‟s second law because it is conserved if there is no net external torque. For 10 points, name this vector quantity equal to the cross product of position and an object‟s mass times its velocity.<br>ANSWER: angular momentum (accept rotational momentum or moment of momentum; do not accept or prompt on "momentum")<br><br>2. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>The area of a lattice is defined as the area of a fundamental one of these shapes. One law named for them states that the sum of the squares of its diagonals equals the sum of the squares of its sides. Like more specific quadrilaterals, the area of one of these shapes equals the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors forming adjacent sides, and the other law named for it is used to add vectors. The diagonals of these polygons bisect one another, and any two adjacent interior angles are supplementary. Name this quadrilateral that has two pairs of congruent, parallel sides.<br>ANSWER: parallelogram(s) [accept unit cell before “squares”]<br><br>3. Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>Architecturally, they are spouts that carry water away from the parapet. They can take on many forms, such as the lions in the city of Pompeii, but they are imposing so as to ward off evil spirits. Named from the French for “throat,” are, for 10 points, what grotesque busts often found on Gothic cathedrals?<br>ANSWER: <u>gargoyle</u>s [prompt on <u>grotesque</u> before it is read]<br><br>4. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>The Boussinesq (BOO-sihn-esk) approximation for this process allows differences in density to be ignored except when they affect buoyancy (BOY- uhn-see), and the Churchill-Bernstein equation can estimate the Nusselt numbers that describe this process. This process is associated with high Prandtl (PRAHND-tull) numbers, and Benard cells model this process in the Earth’s mantle. This usually is caused by a combination of currents and diffusion, and the forced type can be caused by air conditioning and electric fans. Name this form of heat transfer that does not occur in solids which is often contrasted with radiation and conduction.<br>ANSWER: convection<br><br>5. Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>One example of this construct is Gosper Island, which tessellates the plane, and the multi- type of this construct is used to describe systems which require a spectrum of exponents to model their scaling rather than a constant. One of the standard types can be generated by repeatedly moving halfway towards a randomly selected vertex of a triangle or by shading the even numbers in an infinite Pascal’s Triangle. Any standard type of this is linear when a log-log graph is made of repetitions vs scale. Examples include the Cantor Set, Sierpiński sieve, and Koch Snowflake.

Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>The powder type of this phenomenon is a technique used to analyze crystalline solids. Application of this effect to crystal lattices and X-rays was pioneered by the father-son team of Bragg. In microscopes and telescopes, this phenomenon prevents angular resolution beyond a certain point. Types of this phenomenon are named for  Fraunhoffer and Fresnel. Interference patterns that occur due to this phenomenon resulted from Young’s double slit experiment. A namesake grating can be used to separate light of different wavelengths.

In addition to Carl Wilhelm Scheele another person involved in this event suggested using soda water, a process he initially described, as a cure for scurvy, and as a result of this event the phlogiston theory was overturned.

Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>C-waves do not enter this region, and the K in PKP denotes the part of the waves that travel through it. This is the innermost of two regions whose lower boundary is marked by a Lehmann discontinuity, and its upper bound is named after Gutenberg. Refraction of P-waves here causes a </strong> “shadow zone,” and the S-waves cannot move through this region because they are transverse. The dynamo theory explains the geomagnetic field as a result of the rotation of this region.

Science/Chemistry (SCOP Novice 2012)<br><strong>One form of this process is regulated by aquaporins. This process causes gas exchange in alveoli, and it distributes nutrients in flatworms.

For 10 points, name this movement of particles from regions of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration.<br>ANSWER: diffusion (accept passive transport; accept osmosis before "gas exchange")<br><br>13. Science/All (Prison Bowl 2012)<br>Anatol Rapoport created a simulation of this concept using four lines of BASIC code, while another simulation is called Pavlov. A related problem posited by Rousseau is the stag hunt, and this concept was first described by RAND Corporation employees Melvin Dresher and Merrill Flood. Two strategies for a repeated application of this problem are “tit-for-tat” and “win-stay, lose-switch.” One example with multiple players is the tragedy of the commons, and the only Nash equilibrium for this is when both players defect.

Science/All (Bulldog High School Academic Tournament (BHSAT) 2008)<br>The cross product of this quantity with the magnetic field results in the magnetic force on a charged particle. When the drag force is equivalent to the weight of a falling object, the terminal type of this is reached, while the minimum value that must be obtained for one to leave the gravitational field of a planet is known as the escape variety.

Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2011)<br>This term describes systems for which the Euler-Lagrange equation reduces to Newton’s second law, and Helmholtz’s theorem decomposes any force field into a solenoidal one and one with this property. The line integral around a closed loop is zero for this type of force, whose fields are irrotational, which means their curl is zero. These forces can be represented as the gradients of potential energy functions. Exemplified by gravity but not friction, name this type of force whose work is path-independent.<br>ANSWER: <u>conservative forces</u> [accept conservative (force) fields; accept conservative vector fields; accept irrotational fields before “irrotational”; accept curl-free or other answers logically equivalent to having zero curl before “irrotational”]<br><br>16.

Szilárd and Brillouin challenged this concept, arguing that the act of processing information requires energy. In its original formulation, it consisted of two joined containers full of gas particles, which would be allowed to pass from one container to another based on their speed, resulting in a large temperature difference between the two containers.

Uranium hexafluoride undergoes this process during enrichment. Its namesake coefficient is equal to the product of mean free path and velocity. Its flux is equal to the negative of the </strong> concentration gradient in a law named after Fick, and this process is observed as water moves across a semipermeable membrane through osmosis.
