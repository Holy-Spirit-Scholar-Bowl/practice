Science/Math (NASAT 2015)<br>All exact differential forms can be described by this word, since their second exterior derivative is zero. A set is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal can be described by this word. The union of a set and its boundary always has this property. Arbitrary intersections, but not arbitrary unions, of sets of this type produce another set of this type. A topological set is described by this word if it contains all of its limit points.
