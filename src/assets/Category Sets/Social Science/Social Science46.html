1. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2007)<br><strong>This student of Pigou discussed the credit cycle in his Treatise on Money, and recommended that World War Two should be financed by higher taxation instead of deficit spending in How to Pay for the War. The school of economics most </strong> associated with him believes that the multiplier effect produces a disproportionate increase in aggregate demand. He advised the U.S. to use deficit spending to counteract the Great Depression, and is best known for the ideas put forth in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. FTP, name this 20th century British economist.<br>ANSWER: John Maynard <u>Keynes</u><br><br>2. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>The Baumol-Tobin model states that this function is equal to the square root of half the income times the cost of withdrawals, all over the interest rate. This function is equal to the negative ratio of the price and wealth partials of indirect utility in Roy's identity. The unique solutions to the expenditure minimization and utility maximization problems are the primary functions of this type; the </strong> Slutsky equation relates changes in those functions, which are named for Hicks and Marshall. Changes in this function can also be decomposed into substitution and income effects, and for normal goods, its curve slopes downwards, indicating that it decreases as price increases. For 10 points, name this function contrasted with supply, the amount desired of a given good.<br>ANSWER: <u>demand</u> [or <u>demand</u> for money; or <u>Marshallian demand</u>; or <u>Hicksian demand</u> at any point]<br><br>3. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>In one work, this man proposed that conservation and innovation are forms of “residues,” which are then justified through “derivations.” He introduced the Edgeworth Box in Manual of Political Economy. Kaldor and Hicks name the less stringent form of the concept he is best known for, which can replace monotonicity and non-imposition in Arrow's Impossibility theorem. He also names an 80-20 rule of thumb about the breath of income distribution. Mind and Society is a work of, for 10 points, name this Italian economist known for the situation in which no one can be made better off without making someone worse off, his namesake optimality.<br>ANSWER: Vilfredo <u>Pareto</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>Alfred Kroeber wrote about similarities between male and female versions of this entity connected with childbirth. J.M. Whiting wrote that harmful types of these are more common in societies in which male infants spend more time with their mothers. These events title a book by Arnold van Gennep that coined this term. For 10 points, identify these rituals, which exist in all societies and mark the transition from one societal or religious status to another, examples of which include coming of age.<br>ANSWER: <u>Rites</u> of <u>Passage</u><br><br>5. Social Science/None (BELLOCO 2014)<br>This man's namesake rule advocates setting the nominal interest rate at zero, and his proposition that money supply should be increased by a constant percentage rate annually is his namesake k-percent rule. This man proposed reducing government deficit and stopping the creation of more money, contributing to the "Chilean Miracle." This economist argued that policies adopted by the Federal Reserve worsened the Great Depression in a work he co-authored with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States. For 10 points, name this Nobel Prize-winning founder of the Chicago school of economics and author of Capitalism and Freedom.<br>ANSWER: Milton Friedman<br><br>6. Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>David Schneider argued for redefining this concept in symbolic rather than biological terms in a book on the "American" kind of this concept. Compadrazgo is an example of the fictive kind of this concept. Six patterns of this concept were described by Lewis Henry Morgan, including the "generational" Hawaiian system and the "bifurcate merging" Iroquois type. The cognatic form of tracking this concept is divided into bilateral or ambilinial types. Claude </strong> Levi-Strauss argued for an "alliance theory" of this kind of relationship, which is often classified as affinal or consanguineal, in a book entitled The Elementary Structures of [this concept]. For 10 points, give this anthropological term encompassing the study of familial relationships.<br>ANSWER: kinship [prompt on things like \"being related\" or \"family relationships\"]<br><br>7. Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>To support their thesis that there once was a proto-Sapiens language, Bengtson and Ruhlen posited 27 "global" types of this concept. This concept gave its name to Mark Forsyth's "circular stroll" through the English language. This concept, which titles Isidore of Seville's medieval dictionary, also names a fallacy often summarized as "meanings do not change over time." "Hackamore" and "blunderbuss" exemplify a type of this concept which results from </strong> erroneous popular misconceptions, its "folk" type. The study of this concept often makes use of the comparative method to trace derivations from source words. For 10 points, a Greek word meaning "a word's true sense" gives its name to, what study of the origin of words, such as "candid" coming from the Latin for "white"?<br>ANSWER: etymology [accept word forms; accept folk etymology]<br><br>8. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regionals 2011)<br>In this market structure, the average revenue curve is equal to the demand curve, and thus the only way to increase revenue is to lower price. When the barriers to entry which create this structure manifest as extremely high infrastructure cost, this structure is said to be “natural;” examples include water utilities and telecommunications. For 10 points, identify this microeconomic market structure in which a good has only one seller.<br>ANSWER: monopoly<br><br>9. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>It was intended to shed light on the validity of Adolf Eichmann’s war crimes defense, which involved a claim to be “just following orders.” Subjects were told that it was a test of a new learning procedure and that the person on the other side of a wall, actually an actor, was to receive electric shocks for incorrect responses. Twenty-seven of forty participants administered what was believed to be a lethal shock in, for 10 points, what experiment, chronicled in its namesake’s book Obedience to Authority?<br>ANSWER: Stanley <u>Milgram</u> obedience to authority experiment [Milgram’s name is required, prompt on anything reasonable]<br><br>10. Social Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>The writer Richard Brautigan wrote a treatise advocating its abolition, while Keynes wrote about an “illusion” of this, which leads to lagging nominal prices and its multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio. When two forms are available, that which is worse dominates, according to Gresham's Law; that principle explains the dominance of the fiat type of this, in contrast to the commodity form, since its value tends constantly to diminish. FTP, name this economic concept that stores value and facilitates commerce by changing hands when people buy things.<br>ANSWER: <u>money</u> (or <u>currency</u>)<br><br>11. Social Science/All (Maggie Walker GSAC XIX 2011)<br>This man worked with Leonard Savage to theorize that the curve of an individual’s utility function differs based on their wealth. This man’s namesake rule advocated setting the nominal interest at zero, and he argued that licensing doctors resulted in the inflation of their incomes. He worked with Edmund Phelps to develop the concept of the “natural rate of unemployment,” and he criticized Keynesian economics during a period of stagflation, favoring monetarism. For 10 points, name this Chicago school economist who wrote Capitalism and Freedom.<br>ANSWER: Milton <u>Friedman</u><br><br>12. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br>Recent work on this theory suggests that most Asian markets are too vulnerable to manipulation for it to hold true. The Behavioral Finance finding that people engage in hyperbolic discounting suggests that this statement isn’t applicable to most markets. The weak form of this theory asserts that all past market prices and data are fully reflected in securities prices, while the strong form argues that all information is reflected. For 10 points, identify this economic theory developed by Eugene Fama.<br>ANSWER: <u>efficient markets</u> hypothesis<br><br>13. Social Science/All (DAFT 2009)<br>A critic of this work, Derek Freeman, wrote about the unreliability of this work's writer's previous case studies in his namesake, “Unmaking and Making of An Anthropological Myth.” Sections in this work include “Maturity and Old Age” and “Education for Choice” and uses particular studies of people such as the Lola, Mala, and Siva. This work explains the existence of the taupou system, which is one of institutionalized virginity for young women of high rank. The study revolved around the lives of sixty-eight young women living on the island of Tau. For 10 points, name this work by Margaret Mead.<br>ANSWER: Coming of Age in Samoa<br><br>14. Social Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>This experiment was funded by a grant from the U.S. Office of Naval Research. Subjects were acquired for this experiment by a newspaper advertisement offering college students fifteen dollars a day and it was discussed in its designer’s book The Lucifer Effect. Roles were chosen by coinflip, and this experiment was ended after six days instead of the planned two weeks at this insistence of Christina Maslach. For 10 points, name this psychological experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo in which students at a California university were divided into inmates and guards.<br>ANSWER: <u>Stanford Prison</u> Experiment (accept <u>Zimbardo</u> experiment before it is read; prompt on “prison” experiment)<br><br>15. Social Science/None (BISB 2013)<br>An abundance of eels near a lake in this nation is said to have inspired its Bolac stone arrangements. This country contains depictions of the Dynamic Figure and slender spirits called the mimi at Ubirr, a rock art site usually only open to women. Alan Thorne led the effort on studies of this country's Mungo Man. Archeological sites in this nation contain songlines, which the natives believe help them "travel" during Dreamtime. A location sacred to the natives of this country has a distinctive red color and is called Uluru, or Ayers Rock. For 10 points, name this nation home to the Aborigines.<br>ANSWER: Australia<br><br>16. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br><strong>He considered legal, traditional, and charismatic domination in his The Three Types of Legitimate Rule. A lecture by this thinker entitled Politics as a Vocation defined the </strong> state as that entity with a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence. His best-known work refers to bureaucracy with a phrase that Talcott Parsons famously translated as an "iron cage" and tracks the urge to accumulate wealth to Ben Franklin and more directly to John Calvin. For 10 points, name this author of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.<br>ANSWER: Max <u>Weber</u><br><br>17. Social Science/None (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>Maren and Fanselow suggested that neuronal and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala may have been responsible for the results of this experiment, and Mary Cover Jones noted the presence of "degrees of toleration" in a study performed four years after this experiment. Cotton wool, burning newspapers, a white rabbit, and other items initially produced no response in the title subject, who later displayed a conditioned response of fear of the same objects after they were introduced simultaneously with a loud noise. For 10 points, name this experiment that provided evidence of classical conditioning in humans and was conducted by John Watson on the title infant who was made to fear a white rat.<br>ANSWER: Little Albert experiment<br><br>18. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regionals 2011)<br>This language's alphabet contains five letters that must appear in "sofit" form when they are at the end of a sentence. This language uses a series of diacritical marks that render as dots called niqqud. A writer given the title "book seller" was the first to use this language to describe everyday events in literature. The revival of this language coincides with the Second Aliyah, and it replaced languages like Ladino, Bukhori, and Yiddish. For 10 points, name this modern language revived by Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, spoken in Israel.<br>ANSWER: <u>Hebrew</u><br><br>19. Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2012)<br>This work divided sympathetic magic into homoeopathic and contagious magic, the latter of which can be explained by the function of voodoo dolls. It begins by describing the ritual murder of the priest Nemi, and its analysis of the Crucifixion led to criticism of its author. This work discusses the worship and sacrifice of divine kings known as "Kings of the Wood," and it was named after an object utilized to gain access to the underworld in the Aeneid. For 10 points, name this work of comparative religion and mythology written by James Frazer.<br>ANSWER: The Golden Bough<br><br>20. Social Science/All (HFT 2008)<br>He explored class stratification in “Americanism and Fordism” and argued that Marxism was not deterministic in “The Revolution against Das Kapital,” but is better known for rewriting Machiavelli in “The Modern Prince.” Publication of his influential essay on the Southern Question preceded his incarceration, during which he contrasted the traditional intelligentsia with an “organic” one and explained the persistence of the capitalist system with his theory of cultural hegemony. FTP, name this Italian Communist social theorist who wrote the Prison Notebooks.<br>ANSWER: Antonio <u>Gramsci</u><br><br>
