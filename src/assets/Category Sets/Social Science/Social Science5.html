Social Science/None (NTSS 2013)<br>In contrasting necessary quantities to luxuries, this book points out that customs made leather shoes necessary in England but not in France. This work also states that "the skill, dexterity, and judgment with whichlabour is generally applied" is more important than the rate of employment. This book also stated that it would cost thirty times as much money to produce wine in Scotland as in France, so Scotland should allow imported wines.
