Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>The Suits index measures how tax policies play out in societies affected by this condition. Skill-biased technical change can lead to an increase in this property. A text partly titled for this condition notes that the first man to fence off and claim land as his was the true founder of civil society. That discourse by Rousseau contrasts the "natural" and "physical" forms of this condition. A 2014 book by Thomas Piketty argues that this condition has increased in the United States as gains on </strong> capital have grown faster than earnings. The deviation of a Lorenz curve indicates the existence of this condition, which is measured by the Gini coefficient.

For 10 points, name this Scottish economist who outlined the concepts of supply and demand and wrote of an “invisible hand” governing markets in The Wealth of Nations.<br>ANSWER: Adam <u>Smith</u><br><br>10. Social Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 1 2008)<br>Experiments which flew in the face of this school of thought included the preference of Harlow's monkeys for “cloth mother” over “wire mother.” Two competing doctrines of this school are molar and molecular, the former dismissing the claimed proximal causes that the latter determines.

The evolution of palato- and labio-velars from it determines a separation into Centum [kentoom] and Satem groups.
