In another experiment, this man tried to see if a person could get a package to someone across the country through “Six Degrees of Separation.” In addition to the “Lost Letter” and “Small World” experiments, the Nuremburg trials inspired him to create an experiment in which actors responded to questions with incorrect responses, and subjects were told to “please continue” as they delivered what they believed were increasingly painful electrical shocks to the actors.

Social Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>The founder of this philosophy, who initially worked under Henri de Saint-Simon, believed that each branch of science moved through three stages, the first two being theocratic and metaphysical, and the third having the same name as this philosophy. The application of this belief to social sciences was questioned by Wilhelm Dilthey, Heinrich Rickert, and Max Weber based on the importance of symbols and values. The founder of this philosophy proclaimed himself the High Priest of Humanity and devised a calendar with month names such as Moses, Dante, and Gutenberg. This philosophy emphasized observable phenomena and verifiable scientific laws and de-emphasized causation, and its legal branch is associated with utilitarianism and Jeremy Bentham.

Clifford Geertz likened this work to a satire by Jonathan Swift, and it has been criticized for the unusual experiences of a case study named Robert. This work describes it subjects as “debtor[s] to the ages” and includes a section on the regularity of gardens.
