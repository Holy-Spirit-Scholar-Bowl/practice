1. Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>This man worked with Leonard Savage to theorize that the curve of an individual's utility function differs based on their wealth. This man's namesake rule advocated setting the nominal interest at zero, and he argued that licensing doctors resulted in the inflation of their incomes. He worked with Edmund Phelps to develop the concept of the "natural rate of unemployment," and he criticized Keynesian economics during a period of stagflation, favoring monetarism. For 10 points, name this Chicago school economist who wrote Capitalism and Freedom.<br>ANSWER: Milton Friedman<br><br>2. Social Science/None (SCOP Novice 2012)<br><strong>This language borrowed its current third-person plural pronouns from contact with the Danelaw. One of this language's parent languages experienced Grimm's Law, and this language itself underwent the </strong> Great Vowel Shift. Though it is Germanic, this language borrows heavily from French due to the Norman conquest of this language's native country. For 10 points, name this modern language that is spoken widely in Canada and other British colonies.<br>ANSWER: Modern English (accept Old English before "Great Vowel Shift" is read; accept Middle English until "modern" is read)<br><br>3. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 2 2008)<br>One of these, created by Joseph Jastrow and named for two animals, was discussed in relation to paradigm shifts in Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions. The one named for Franz Muller-Lyer involves arrows, and the one named for Hermann Ebbinghaus involves the size of two circles. One of these associated with Gestalt involves being shown stationary objects in rapid succession, and is known as the phi phenomenon. For 10 points, name these phenomena in which a visual image is deceptive.<br>ANSWER: optical illusions [prompt on illusions]<br><br>4. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 15 2011)<br><strong>The theory that this phenomenon is a function of social structures is known as strain theory. James Q. Wilson and George Kelling theorized that it can be prevented by decreasing urban disorder, the so-called "broken windows" theory. Cesare Beccaria (say-ZAR-ay beck-CAR-ee-ah) and Jeremy Bentham advocated </strong> punishment as a deterrent for it, but discouraged the death penalty. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which laws are broken.<br>ANSWER: crime<br><br>5. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>Piero Sfraffa argued in favor of this man's theories. He rejected his own theory that deficit-based spending cannot increase demand because consumers can predict a future tax increase. In addition to that namesake “equivalence,” he is known for a law stating that the wage of workers stabilizes at the sustenance level. Active in British politics, he took the Bullionist position and opposed the Corn Laws. For 10 points, who is this classical economist famous for his Iron Law of Wages and Principles of Political Economy and Taxation which introduced comparative advantage?<br>ANSWER: David <u>Ricardo</u> [<u>DU/SJ</u>]<br><br>6. Social Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>A gap in this quantity is related with unemployment in Okun’s law, and cost-push inflation is characterized by a decrease in this value. It differs from its counterpart in that it does not account for investments by foreigners nor investments held by natives in [*] other countries. Calculated using the income or expenditure approach, this value is defined as the sum of private consumption, gross investment, government spending and net exports. A decrease in it for two consecutive quarters is known as a recession. Also known as aggregate demand, for 10 points, identify this quantity that is equal to the net goods and services produced in a country.<br>ANSWER: <u>gross domestic product</u> [accept <u>GDP</u>]<br><br>7. Social Science/All (MW GSAC XVII 2009)<br>This man was influenced by his studies at Salpetriere under Jean-Martin Charcot, who described physical diseases with neurological bases. His daughter Anna expanded on his theory of the defense mechanism, and he proposed the concept of the “death drive” in Beyond the Pleasure Principle. He theorized the psyche in terms of the superego, ego, and id, and he developed five stages of psychosexual development. For 10 points, name this Austrian psychologist and founder of psychoanalysis.<br>ANSWER: Sigmund <u>Freud</u><br><br>8. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2007)<br><strong>He used the term ‘synchronicity’ to describe two meaningful, but unexplainable occurrences among two people. He also coined the term ‘anima’ to denote the feminine aspect of a man and its counterpart ‘animus’ </strong> in women. He wrote of the psychological predisposition that all humans share which explains the several motifs in isolated groups which he called ‘collective unconscious’. FTP, identify this Swiss psychoanalytical psychologist who told of idealized models of people and objects called archetypes.<br>ANSWER: Carl Gustav <u>Jung</u><br><br>9. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>He considered himself a Freudian psychologist, but later writers called him an “ego psychologist.” He wrote a book about Gandhi and the origin of “militant nonviolence” in one book, and he coined the term “identity crisis” in his study of adolescence. Under his model, a person must successfully resolve the conflict and integrate the skills from each stage. For 10 points, name this man who used the “psychohistory” method to write Young Man Luther, and whose theory of lifelong development contains eight stages.<br>ANSWER: Erik <u>Erikson</u><br><br>10. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>The "Pigouvian" type of these things are used to correct negative externalities. Their rate is plotted on the x axis of the Laffer curve. The rate of progressive ones rise with increasing value of the target. Some politicians and economists propose reforming these in the U.S. by levying a flat one. The 16th amendment allows the federal government to impose an income one. For 10 points, name these economically entities used by governments to raise money.<br>ANSWER: <u>taxes</u><br><br>11. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 2 2008)<br>Constant utility is an assumption of the Hicksian form of this concept, which is in general less preferred than the Marshallian form if emprical data is available; the two forms are related by the Slutsky equation. The Marshallian version takes into account the income and substitution effects, and the shape of this curve is positive for Veblen and Giffen goods. For 10 points, name this concept that denotes an individual's willingness to buy a certain item given a particular price.<br>ANSWER: demand curve<br><br>12. Social Science/All (Brookwood Invitational Scholars Bowl 2013)<br>These events occur because of PGO spikes and facilitate “reverse learning” according to a model of Crick and Mitchison. Hobson and McCarley stated that these events attempt to make sense of random activity in their formulation of the activation-synthesis theory. The symbolic meanings of these occurrences are called latent content and are covered up by the manifest content. One psychologist argued that these experiences satisfy the otherwise unacceptable feelings of the unconscious in his wish-fulfillment theory. For 10 points, name these events which are the subject of an “interpretation” in a book by Sigmund Freud and occur most vividly during REM sleep.<br>ANSWER: <u>dream</u>s<br><br>13. Social Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>It is determined by resource allotment according the Heckscher-Olin model, and Paul Craig Roberts claimed it doesn't exist when capital is mobile. Conceived of by Robert Torrens in 1815, it was discussed two years later in [*] Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, with the example of easily-made English cloth and Portuguese wine. For 10 points, name this international trade theory of David Ricardo, saying that countries should only produce goods for which their opportunity cost is lowest, in contrast to absolute advantage.<br>ANSWER: theory of <u>comparative advantage</u><br><br>14. Social Science/All (RAVE 2012)<br><strong>One of this thinker’s ideas is discussed in a Jacques Derrida essay in which Derrida contrasts an idea of this person with the individual who should “construct the totality of his language, syntax, and lexicon.” This thinker sought to reduce myths into “mythemes,” and he discussed Brazilian cultures like the Bororo in his Tristes Tropiques. This man included The Origin of Table Manners in one of his works, and he contrasted the </strong> “engineer” with the approaches of “bricolage” in his The Savage Mind. For 10 points, identify this French structural anthropologist who included The Raw and the Cooked in his Mythologiques.<br>ANSWER: Claude <u>Levi-Strauss</u><br><br>15. Social Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>His most famous finding was repeated by Charles Holfing in a hospital setup involving the drug Astroten, and this man supervised breachings asking able-bodied people to give up seats in New York subways. He planted sealed envelopes in public, his “lost letters”, and [*] his small world experiment led to the phrase “six degrees of separation”. His most famous experiment involved the learning of associated words, and was inspired by the Eichmann trial. For 10 points, name this Yale psychologist who observed obedience to authority by finding that 65 percent of people would eventually administer 450-volt shocks.<br>ANSWER: Stanley <u>Milgram</u><br><br>16. Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>This man prefigured Tobin's Q model by linking stock market valuation to aggregate investment in the economy. He attempted to explain U.S business after World War I and before the Great Depression in Absentee Ownership. He promoted technocracy in The Engineers and the Price System, and his namesake set of luxury goods increases in price with demand. One of his works pioneers the idea of "conspicuous consumption".

Social Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>One form of this quantity is on the horizontal axis of the IS/LM model, which plots interest rate on the other axis. The velocity of money is equal to one type of this quantity over the total money supply, and, in The Affluent Society, Galbraith attacked this measure for not taking into account social considerations. A 1% increase in unemployment leads to a 2% decrease in this quantity, according to </strong> Okun’s Law. It can be calculated via the income approach or the expenditure approach. For ten points, identify this economic measure of the value of all goods and services produced in a country.<br>ANSWER: <u>G</u>ross <u>D</u>omestic <u>P</u>roduct (or <u>G</u>ross <u>N</u>ational <u>P</u>roduct)<br><br>18. Social Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>This man's essay on “Baloma” spirits appears in one collection, and he attempted to disprove the universal Oedipal complex in another work.

Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2012)<br><strong>Mortensen used Search and Matching Theory to model one form of this phenomenon, while external expectations create multiple equilibrium points for it according to Peter Diamond's Coconut Model. The Shapiro-Stiglitz model implies that efficiency wages sustain this phenomenon, which is similarly maintained according to the NAIRU model developed by Phelps and Friedman. Okun's law posits the </strong> inverse relationship between this and GDP, while the Beveridge Curve is particularly useful in modeling a type of this phenomenon created by mismatched conditions, its "frictional" form. The Phillips Curve plots inflation against, for 10 points, what economic phenomenon in which laborers are out of work?<br>ANSWER: <u>unemployment</u> [or equivalents like <u>joblessness;</u> do NOT accept more general answers like \"poverty\"]<br><br>20. Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2013)<br>This writer’s best known work states that “There are three classes of intellects: one which comprehends   by itself; another which appreciates what others comprehended; and a third which neither comprehends  by itself nor by the showing of others.” This person also wrote a work discussing the actions in another   writer’s book Ab urbe condita, a history of Rome. This person wrote it is safer to be feared than  loved, and he described different ways for leaders to gain and maintain power.
