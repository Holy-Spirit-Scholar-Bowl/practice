1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 10 2009)<br><strong>A story prefaced to William Caxton's translation of the Aeneid tells of a merchant's attempt to converse with a Middle English-speaking woman who does not understand this word, and only knows of “eyren.” This word is “baydah” in Arabic, “yaytso” in Russian, and “ji dan” in Mandarin. It is “oón” (oh-AHN) in classical Greek and </strong> “ovum” in Latin, which is why animals that feed primarily on these are called “oviparous.” For 10 points, identify this food item, which is known as “l'oeuf” in French and “el huevo” (WAY-voh) in Spanish.<br>ANSWER: <u>eggs</u><br><br>2. Social Science/All (BHSAT 2011)<br>This man claimed that Say’s Law, the classical economic concept that excess supply creates its own demand, was invalid; the intersection of aggregate demand as a function of output and the line representing the equality of aggregate demand and output is called this man’s namesake “cross.” This economist called for governments to counter cyclical unemployment, and claimed that the reparations imposed on Germany would lead to hyperinflation and economic stagnation in Economic Consequences of the Peace.

Social Science/Norse (LIST (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament) 2014)<br><strong>According to a theory developed by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, an expansionary monetary policy does not change this quantity in the long run, where wages are not sticky. The non-accelerating inflation rate of this quantity, which replaced the theory of its "natural rate", is equivalent to the Y-axis of the long-run </strong> Phillips curve, whose short-run form posits a tradeoff between this quantity and inflation. The cyclical type of this occurs due to insufficient demand in the labor market, while the frictional type results when people move between jobs. For ten points, name this phenomenon in which people are unable to find work<br>ANSWER: unemployment<br><br>8.

Social Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>It was extensively studied by Darley and Latane, whose experiments involved situations such as smoke slowly filling a room or a confederate having a seizure. Causes of it include deference to more-qualified authority, diffusion of responsibility, and pluralistic ignorance, in which people look to their companions for direction. In the most famous example of it, a woman was stabbed to death in the presence of more than thirty witnesses, none of whom called for help. For 10 points, the murder of Kitty Genovese was an example of what phenomenon, in which the presence of others prevents individuals from acting in emergencies?<br>ANSWER: <u>bystander</u> effect<br><br>11. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 10 2009)<br><strong>This economist argued that central planning and vertical integration replace supply and demand in large corporations in The New Industrial State.

This writer described six patterns for how women behave in commercials and billboards in his book Gender Advertisements, and argued that people interpret political events through what he called their "primary frame." In his major work, this sociologist argued that the protection of "secrets" was necessary for the preservation of a "team," whose "front stage" activity differs from its "back stage." In that book, this sociologist analyzed the concept of "impression management" and used analogies from the theater to model the way people put on roles in front of others. For 10 points, name this sociologist who developed the "dramaturgical model" of social interaction in The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.<br>ANSWER: Erving Goffman<br><br>14. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>This organization was first established by the Statute of Westminster. The 1991 Heads of Government Meeting in Zimbabwe reaffirmed a declaration stating its voluntary and cooperative nature first put forth in the meeting twenty years earlier in Singapore, and its original definition was stretched with the admission of Mozambique in 1995. Burma rejected membership upon independence in 1948, and Ireland, </strong> South Africa, and Pakistan withdrew from it, although the latter two have since rejoined.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>A 2005 variation on this experiment used functional MRI and 3-dimensional objects, noting that the part of the brain keen on perception was most active in its subjects. This experiment was itself a follow-up to Sharif's autokinetic effect study and found that a “true partner” superseded a “compromise partner.” Seven confederates were used in most iterations, though the results held for as few as three and found that a third of people agreed with the confederates' consensus on an answer.

Social Science/All (HAVOC II 2009)<br>This work proposes a series of stages of economic development progressing from hunting to nomadic agronomy to feudal farming to business interdependence. This work introduced early formulations of the labor theory of value as well as comparative advantage. In it, land, labor, and capital are referred to as the three factors of production. More importantly, it attacks mercantilism and states that economic growth is dependent on the accumulation of capital. Speaking of a system of “perfect liberty”, FTP, name this book which posited the “invisible hand” and called for a free market economy, the central work of Adam Smith.<br>ANSWER: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the <u>Wealth of Nations</u><br><br>17.

Languages with phrase structure which can be computed by Turing machines form the Type-0 tier of his grammar hierarchy, and he theorized that a precise set of rules could predict all of the grammatically possible sentences in a language. For 10 points, name this author of Cartesian Linguistics and Syntactic Structures and theorist of transformational-generative grammar, a noted MIT linguist.<br>ANSWER: Noam <u>Chomsky</u><br><br>19.

He believed that the Hopi language contained no conception of time and no grammatical structure, and most of his essays are collected posthumously in Language, Thought, and Reality.
