Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2006)<br>Along with Edmund Phelps, he argued that real wages will adjust to provide an equilibrium between the supply and demand for labor, leading to a “natural rate” of unemployment.

Cotton wool, burning newspapers, a white rabbit, and other items initially produced no response in the title subject, who later displayed a conditioned response of fear of the same objects after they were introduced simultaneously with a loud noise. For 10 points, name this experiment that provided evidence of classical conditioning in humans and was conducted by John Watson on the title infant who was made to fear a white rat.<br>ANSWER: Little Albert experiment<br><br>8. Social Science/All (MW GSAC XVII 2009)<br>One concept introduced in this work is a calculable ratio between income and investment termed the multiplier, and this work explains the concepts of prime cost and supplementary cost as functions of the sacrifice of value from producing a good, the user cost.

Later, at Princeton University, he was disliked by his colleagues due to his eccentric personality and schizophrenia, but he was well-known for his namesake equilibrium theory regarding non-cooperative games, which contributed to his influential role in the mathematical field of game theory.

He created a social fitness model that he later implemented in his Shyness Clinic, but he may be better known for an experiment ended by Christina Maslach, in which one participant assumed the role of a character from Cool Hand Luke.

Social Science/All (Brookwood Invitational Scholars Bowl 2013)<br>Robert Nozick’s “experience machine” thought experiment attacks this concept as the only intrinsic value by putting people in a place devoted only to it. An attempt to quantify the effects of it uses duration and intensity as two of seven “dimensions” in its namesake “calculus”. Aristotle argued this concept manifests itself as the highest human state through eudaimonia. Epicurus equated the lack of pain to the highest possible amount of this state. According to Sigmund Freud, the id is compulsively driven to find this state in a namesake “principle”.
