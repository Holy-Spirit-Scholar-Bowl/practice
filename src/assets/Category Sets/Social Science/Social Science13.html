Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>SNARE proteins facilitate reassembly of Golgi bodies during this event, and subpore complexes bind to partially decondensing chromosomes, resulting in several karyomeres. In plant cells, the creation of the new cell plate occurs during this stage, and in animals it generally produces a cleavage furrow, ultimately resulting in two identical daughter cells.
