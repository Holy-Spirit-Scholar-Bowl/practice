1. Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Alberto Alesina and Larry Summers summarized results showing that this phenomenon decreases as central bank independence increases. According to the Taylor principle, an increase in this phenomenon necessitates a corresponding increase in the interest rate. Increases on the y-axis in the ADAS model represent this phenomenon, which can occur when aggregate demand grows </strong> faster than aggregate supply. In 1981, the Fed chairman Paul Volcker intentionally caused a recession in order to combat this phenomenon. Milton Friedman claimed that it "is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon," supporting the theory that it only happens due to increases in the money supply. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which prices increase and money becomes less valuable.<br>ANSWER: inflation [or inflation rate; or price inflation; prompt on descriptions such as increase in price [levels]; do not accept or prompt on "deflation"]<br><br>2. Social Science/None (BELLOCO 2014)<br>In one work, this author noted a rapid adaptation to twentieth century life among the Manus Islanders. Besides writing New Lives for Old, this person observed how one group carried their babies in baskets and beat them until they stopped crying; those people were the Mundugumor Islanders. This person disproved the stereotype of primitive people acting like children while living among the people of Tau Island, and asserted that adolescence was formulated based on cultural experiences in Growing Up in New Guinea. For 10 points, name this anthropologist who observed the sexual freedom of women on a Pacific island in Coming of Age in Samoa.<br>ANSWER: Margaret Mead<br><br>3. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>This thinker posited a “division of knowledge” and noted that price is a mechanism of communicating information in works like “On the Use of Knowledge in Society.” In another work, this man distinguished between minimum sustenance and standard of life in a chapter examining “Two Kinds of Security.” This man included an appendix onto his work The Constitution of Freedom entitled </strong> “Why I am Not a Conservative” and won the 1974 Nobel in Economics along with Gunnar Myrdal, primarily for his thesis tying central planning to social stagnation. For 10 points, name this Austrian-born economist who argued that Nazism and Soviet totalitarianism have their origins in socialism in The Road to Serfdom.<br>ANSWER: Friedrich von <u>Hayek</u><br><br>4. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>This theorist distinguished primary, secondary, and tertiary circular reactions from reflexes. With Bärbel Inhelder, he used a model of three mountains in one study to test de-centering, the ability to overcome egocentrism. He called himself a “genetic epistemologist,” and claimed people either assimilate a new experience into old frameworks or accommodate it, creating new </strong> “schemas.” His most famous model includes understanding of conservation years after grasping that things which disappear from view have object permanence. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist who included sensorimotor and concrete operational as the first and third stages of child cognitive development.<br>ANSWER: Jean <u>Piaget</u> (pyah-ZHEY)<br><br>5. Social Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>Hotelling's law describes one beneficial outcome of this situation.  William Baumol described a “Revolution” in the theory of this type of market, which claims that low entry cost markets are unfavorable to this situation.  In this situation, profit maximization occurs when setting marginal cost equal to marginal revenue, which will result in a lower quantity sold at a higher price and thus deadweight loss.  For 10 points, name this market structure in which there is one producer.<br>ANSWER: monopolies<br><br>6. Social Science/All (UIUC High School Solo 2008)<br>Cost-push inflation occurs as a result of the decline in it paired with an increase in the price level, while demand-pull inflation is caused by a rise in it as well as the price level. Calculated through either the circular flow model or the income approach, the ratio of capital stock over it is known as the capital-output ratio, and when unadjusted for price, it is referred to as nominal. The total value of all final goods and services produced in an economy with resources from that economy, FTP, identify this economic value also known as the GDP.<br>ANSWER: <u>Gross Domestic Product</u> (accept GDP until the end)<br><br>7. Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2008)<br>Vocabulary  In economics, this adjective is often contrasted with the word ‘real’ and is used when calculations do not correct for inflation. In general, it refers to a word or group of words functioning as a noun. It can also refer to trivial amounts, such as the payment in a lawsuit where the defendant was guilty but no harm was done. Give this seven-letter word beginning with the letter N.<br>ANSWER: Nominal<br><br>8. Social Science/None (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>This thinker studied the effects of economic change on behavioral patterns in the towns of Modjokuto and Tabanan in one work. In another work, he described the swidden and sawah systems of farming and examined the effect of Dutch rule on Indonesian agricultural productivity. This thinker described his method of ethnography, which attempted to describe the context of behaviors instead of just the behaviors themselves, as "thick description," and wrote that "man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun" in a work that outlined his case for symbolic anthropology. For 10 points, name this author of The Interpretation of Cultures.<br>ANSWER: Clifford (James) Geertz<br><br>9. Social Science/All (HSAPQ NSC 2 2008)<br>In International Relations Theory, this university is home to suicide bombing expert Robert Pape, as well as the founder of “Offensive Realism,” John J. Mearsheimer. This university's law school lost Cass Sunstein to Harvard and is home to Richard Posner. One professor from this school developed capture theory, while another developed the concept of rational expectations. Apart from Robert Lucas and George Stigler, this school is associated with a man who pioneered the wealth effect and wrote Free to Choose to oppose government regulation. For 10 points, name this university best known for its namesake school of free market economics, located in the Windy City.<br>ANSWER: University of <u>Chicago</u><br><br>10. Social Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>This man described a middle-class girl's wish to marry a prince as unlikely in one work critical of religion; in another, he claims the title figure was a murdered relative of Akhenaten. In addition to The Future of an Illusion and Moses and Monotheism, he and Joseph Breuer described Bertha Pappenheim, who he called [*] Anna O, in “Studies on Hysteria,” and in another work he described manifest and latent content within the title occurrences and introduced the Oedipus complex. For 10 points, name this man who wrote The Interpretation of Dreams and divided the psyche into the Id, Ego, and Superego.<br>ANSWER: Sigmund <u>Freud</u><br><br>11. Social Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>In this work, freedom and indulgence is described as a U shape, maximizing for babies and the old. Because a field trip was impossible, research for this book depended on the work of John Embree. This book's writer wanted to study a subject that supposedly had been described by the most fantastic series of “but also's” ever used. Chapters such as “Clearing One's Name”, “Self Discipline”, and “Taking One's Proper Station” were intended to explain a foreign cul- ture that the author's country was at war with, trying to give insight into why its prisoners were not interested in con- tacting family members. Name this work in anthropology published in 1946 that was written by Ruth Benedict about Japan.<br>ANSWER: The <u>Chrysanthemum</u> and the <u>Sword</u><br><br>12. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2001)<br>This technique requires fieldwork that necessarily involves participant- observation, in which the observer establishes an informant or two, developing a relationship in the hopes of extracting information from the informant concerning the informant's culture. For ten points, identify this anthropological technique in which the anthropologist attempts to prepare a description and analysis of a single society.<br>ANSWER: <u>Ethnography</u><br><br>13. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>In a paper describing the economy of professional beekeeping, James Meade argued that this statement could not possibly hold true for bargaining involving pollination. Judge Learend Hand applied a version of this statement to the case US v. Caroll Towing. The “invariance” version of this statement is sometimes negated by the wealth effects that change prices and distributions, while the </strong> “efficiency” version of this theorem is designed to abate the need for Pigouvian taxes. First stated in the work The Problem of Social Cost, for 10 points, name the theorem that states that, when trade in an externality is possible and there are no transaction costs, bargaining will lead to an efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocation of property rights.<br>ANSWER: <u>Coase’s</u> Theorem<br><br>14. Social Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2011)<br><strong>One type of this action occurs due to normlessness, and another is caused by “excessive individiation”. The altruistic and egotistic types of this action were so named by the man who theorized “anomie”, another cause of this action. Another type of this action was part of the </strong> bushido code and was commonly performed by the samurai. This action is sometimes referred to as hari-kari or seppuku, and was studied in great length by Emile Durkheim. For ten points, what is this method of death, commited by Yukio Mishima, Erwin Rommel, and kamikazes, which was notably assisted in by Dr. Kevorkian?<br>ANSWER: <u>Suicide </u>(accept equivalents)<br><br>15. Social Science/All (SCOP Novice 2010)<br><strong>Robert Gordon proposed a triangle model of this phenomenon that includes Paul Samuelson's "cost-push" theory, as well as the "demand-pull" type. As Fed Chairman, Paul Volcker famously raised interest rates to control this phenomenon. Graphed on the Phillips curve against </strong> unemployment and measured by changes in the Consumer Price Index, name this economic phenomenon, the devaluing of money as prices rise, which combines with unemployment in stagflation.<br>ANSWER: <u>inflation</u><br><br>16. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>Daniel Goleman posited the fantastically named “amygdala hijack” in a 1996 work about one form of this concept. Sternberg's triarchic theory of it undervalues statistical input, and Howard Gardner advocated the multiple interpretation of this concept. Robert Yerkes's research was incorporated into one metric examining this by David Wechsler, which was aimed at supplanting an earlier model co-named for Lewis Terman's </strong> university and for the teacher of French researcher Theodore Simon. Stephen Jay Gould revised his Mismeasure of Man to refute a study by Herrnstein and Murray examining this faculty. Measured by the Stanford-Binet scale and controversially to with race in The Bell Curve, for 10 points, identify this cognitive faculty often measured by a numerical “quotient.”<br>ANSWER: <u>intelligence</u> [accept <u>intelligence quotient</u> or <u>IQ</u> ]<br><br>17. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Districts 2011)<br>In one experiment, this psychologist showed that people are more likely to mail a lost letter to a socially acceptable recipient. He instructed people in Kansas and Nebraska to get a package to a stockbroker in Boston in his small world experiment. For 10 points, name this American psychologist who conducted an experiment in which people showed obedience to authority by administrating seemingly painful shocks to strangers.<br>ANSWER: Stanley <u>Milgram</u><br><br>18. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 11 2009)<br><strong>This language does not use syllables, but moras. An n at the end of a syllable in this language counts as a separate mora. Generally speaking, it uses the particle ga to indicate a subject and wa to indicate a topic. This language uses various scripts, including one based on </strong> Chinese characters, kanji, and two syllabic scripts, hiragana and katakana. For 10 points, name this language spoken in Tokyo.<br>ANSWER: <u>Japanese</u> [or <u>Nihongo</u>]<br><br>19. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>This man argued that although primitive societies bind individuals to achieve mechanical solidarity, more complex societies achieve organic solidarity through voluntary bonds of interdependence. He elucidated his approach to sociology in The Rules of the Sociological Method. Based on his field work on Australian aborigines, he argued that religion reflects society rather than divinity in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This author of The Division of Labor in Society described fatalistic, egotistic, and altruistic varieties of the title phenomenon in his most famous work. For 10 points, name the French author of who introduced the concept of anomie in Suicide.<br>ANSWER: Émile <u>Durkheim</u><br><br>20. Social Science/All (JAMES 2013)<br><strong>When performing this action fails the independence of clones criterion, the spoiler effect may occur. The Borda count is a method of performing this action. Non-dictatorship and Pareto efficiency are among three criteria that cannot all be met in any method for performing this action according to an </strong> impossibility theorem named after Kenneth Arrow. Condorcet names a method for performing it, and an unfair advantage in the process of this action can be given by gerrymandering. After using the plurality method for this action, an instant runoff may be necessary. For 10 points, name this method by which people may elect officeholders from among candidates.<br>ANSWER: <u>voting</u> (accept word forms; accept "electing" along with word forms and any specific office before "elect" is read)<br><br>
