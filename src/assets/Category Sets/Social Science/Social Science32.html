1. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2010)<br>This work discusses the names of the dead as "Tabooed Words" and human sacrifice in fire-festivals. It discusses the "Killing of the Tree-Spirit" with reference to a ritual murder governing the succession of Nemi's priesthood of Diana.

Social Science/All (WUHSAC IX 2007)<br>In 1999, he was the first public figure to misquote Al Gore as having claimed to have invented the Internet. In 2006, Republicans of his home state urged him to consider a Senate run instead of eventual candidate Katharine Harris, but he declined.

For ten points, who is this former Florida member of the U.S. House who resigned amidst a scandal of inappropriate contact with House pages?<br>ANSWER: Rep. Mark <u>Foley</u><br><br>4. Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2013)<br>The first variation of this situation involved blinking lights, while a later version took place in a rundown building to see if prestige of setting made a difference. The eighth variation out of a proposed nineteen for this experiment tested the actions of women, which found comparable results to the original experiment involving only men. This experiment involved "teachers" and "learners," and 65 percent of participants turned the applied voltage to the maximum level. For 10 points, name this study done on obedience in which participants were instructed to administer electric shocks.<br>ANSWER: Milgram Experiment [prompt on answers describing the experiment such as "obedience" or "obedience to authority"]<br><br>5. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2010)<br><strong>One experiment involving a theory explaining this involved an attractive female confederate on a swaying suspension bridge.  Ekman's theory of these is based on seven primary states and Zajonc's hypothesis is based on facial feedback.  Two of these theories named for </strong> James-Lange and Cannon-Bard differ in the direction of the causal arrow.  Schachter and Singer used an experiment with the fake drug Suproxin to develope a two-factor theory which describes this phenomena as explaining undifferentiated arousal.

Social Science/None (Harvard Fall Tournament 2012)<br>One person of this surname analyzed forgetfulness and loyalty to the dead in the work "About Losing and Being Lost." That thinker contributed to a field mainly concerned with "defense analysis," which that person claimed can be studied through the manifestation of a person's associations. Another person of this surname discovered a phenomenon in which people shift feelings about one person to another, called transference. That thinker also discussed "thanatos," or the death drive, in his work Beyond the Pleasure Principle.

For 10 points, name this leader of the Physiocrats.<br>ANSWER: François <u>Quesnay</u><br><br>8. Social Science/None (BELLOCO 2014)<br>n one work, this man described how boys in a certain society were disciplined by their uncles, rather than their fathers, leading this man to observe that power, rather than sexual jealousy, is the cause of the Oedipus Complex in that culture. In the last chapter of one work, this man recorded spells used in growing gardens in Coral Gardens and their Magic. In another work, this man described how red shell necklaces and white shell armbands are traded in different directions. That work analyzes the Trobriand Islanders' exchange of the Kula ring.

Social Science/All (MW GSAC XVII 2009)<br>This psychologist theorized the process of “equilibration” as achieving a balance between “assimilation” and “accommodation,” both of which utilize mental structures paired with the physical means of acquiring knowledge termed “schema.” One of his models proposes that a child can think logically but only in terms of material objects from the ages of 7-11. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist who posited sensori-motor, pre-operational, concrete operational, and formal operational as his four stages of cognitive development.<br>ANSWER: Jean <u>Piaget</u><br><br>10. Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>This thinker used the Twelve Tables, the Hebrew Torah, and the laws of Christian Europe to argue that civilization's laws have moved from being repressive to restitutive. This author called the mass of knowledge and beliefs of average members of a society the "collective conscience." This thinker theorized his discipline as a science of </strong> social facts. He argued that individualism persists in complex societies through organic solidarity, while primitive societies are bound by mechanical solidarity. The Division of Labor in Society is a pioneering book by this author, who also wrote a monograph which divides its title acts into "egoistic," "altruistic," "fatalistic," and "anomic" types. For 10 points, name this French sociologist who wrote Suicide.<br>ANSWER: Émile Durkheim [or David Émile Durkheim]<br><br>11. Social Science/None (Masonic 2014)<br>John Maynard Keynes [kanes] argued in The Economic Consequences of the Peace that if left unchecked or controlled by force of law, this phenomenon would lead to relaxed production. Several economists incorrectly predicted that quantitative easing would cause this phenomenon to become a major problem. One theory posits that a back-and-forth between wage hikes and price increases creates a "spiral" that leads to the "cost-push" form of this. Name this trend of the supply of money, and subsequently prices, to rise over time.<br>ANSWER: (hyper) inflation<br><br>12. Social Science/None (NASAT 2015)<br>It's not behavior, but Ulric Neisser coined the term for the "echoic" form of this process. A model of this process includes a component known as the "episodic buffer." John Palmer co-led a study showing that this process was affected by verb choice like "collided" and "smashed" in analyzing a car crash. The conductor of that study observed errors in this process when participants in another study were told that they became lost in a shopping mall. The serial position effect explains troubles with this process, which was studied by Elizabeth Loftus. George Miller proposed that "seven plus or minus two" bits of information can be held by the "working" form of this process. For 10 points, identify this process that is impaired by amnesia.<br>ANSWER: memory<br><br>13. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 2 2008)<br>She wrote, "Yet am I somewhat greedy when I pray/To some far wood along my sun-pressed way" in the poem "Traveler's Faith." Her second husband published a book on the religion of the island of Manus; she herself collected over 35,000 drawings from the children of Manus, which she used in the book Growing Up in New Guinea.

Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>This concept partially titles an A.J. Ayer work that sought to eliminate metaphysics and proposed its verification principle. In the study of this concept, Saul Kripke proposed rigid designators, which designate the same thing in all possible worlds. A Bertrand Russell essay in the study of this concept argues that all names are definite descriptors. The beetle-in-a-box argument addresses its private type, which Ludwig Wittgenstein argued cannot exist. Persistent questions in the study of this concept include how it denotes meaning, and to what extent it is acquired or innate. For 10 points, name this structured form of spoken, written, or signed communication.<br>ANSWER: <u>language</u> [accept private <u>language</u>]<br><br>15. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>An essay in this field discusses the decline of aura in the age of mechanical reproduction, and was written by Walter Benjamin. Another work in this field emphasizes the need for “free play” and defines a disinterested, universal, and necessary judgment. That work is Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Judgment. This field was discussed in terms of the Apollonian and Dionysian in a work that criticizes the excess rationality of Socrates and Euripides and praises Richard Wagner. This field is the subject of Friedrich Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy. For 10 points, name this field of philosophy concerned with the nature of art and beauty.<br>ANSWER: <u>aesthetics</u><br><br>16. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>Lewis Mumford compared these entities to magnets and containers in his book about this concept "in history," and Jane Jacobs wrote about the "Death and Lifeof Great American" ones. Ernest Burgess developed a model for these using concentric rings that centers on the central business district, while Lincoln Steffens attacked their corruption in a book about the "shame" of these entities. Planned ones include Chandigarh, Astana, and Canberra. For 10 points, name these highly populated entities, whose American examples include Phoenix and Chicago.<br>ANSWER: cities<br><br>17. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2005)<br>It defines four separate classifications into which the title action might fall, two of which its author considers “noble” and two of which he labels “base.” One “noble” version is the  “egoistic” type, in which the perpetrator of the act is a great spirit being destroyed by the cruel universe, while one “base” version is the “anomic” type, in which case the action is perpetrated due to a perceived lack of identity. For ten points identify this landmark sociology text by French thinker Emile Durkheim.<br>ANSWER: Suicide<br><br>18. Social Science/All (St. Anselms and Torrey Pines 2011)<br>This man suggested that “Baloma” spirits play a key role in conception ideologies and explain matrilineal descent systems while disproving the universality of the Oedipus Complex. This author of Sex and Repression in Savage Society described building and launching canoes in a work that explains the [*] exchange of trinkets as “half-commerical and half-ceremonial.” This man described the kula ring of the Trobriand Islands in a work followed by his Coral Gardens and their Magic.

Important concepts in this field include phonemes and the Universal Grammar. For 20 points, name this field which is dominated by the generative theories of Noam Chomsky, and is the study of language.<br>ANSWER: <u>linguistics</u><br><br>
