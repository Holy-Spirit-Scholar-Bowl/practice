1. Social Science/None (NASAT 2015)<br>A 1967 Herbert Gans book used participant observation to study the "ways of life and politics" in one of these places. Kenneth Jackson studied the role of the HOLC in the history of these places in his book Crabgrass Frontier.

Social Science/Norse (PACE NSC 2013)<br><strong>One theory of this concept notes that unjustified attention paid to small probabilities leads to a "fourfold pattern" of attitudes about this phenomenon. People's willingness to undergo this phenomenon is subject to a "reflection effect" based on the magnitude of its probability, according to the "prospect theory" developed by Kahneman and Tversky. The Arrow-Pratt coefficient measures the </strong> "aversion" to this quantity, which can be considered identical to the valuing of certainty. The incentive to take on more of this quantity because costs are not borne by the same person who benefits is the moral hazard problem.

Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2012)<br>In a paper by Alan Deardorff on the general validity of the law of this concept, he demonstrates that it works when one takes an average across commodities, even though it falls apart for a small number of commodities. One measure of this is the autarky price, which is an attempt to calculate what prices would be if all economies were self-sufficient.  Paul Krugman [KROOG-man] updated this idea to include economies of scale, explaining discrepancies between the Heckscher-Ohlin Model and actual practice. An early attempt to explain this appeared in On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, which looked at the production of wine and cloth in England and Portugal.
