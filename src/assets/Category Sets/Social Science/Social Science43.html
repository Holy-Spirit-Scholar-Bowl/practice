1. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2004)<br>Under the Kaldor-Hicks model, it occurs when the value of social resources is increased such that the overall gains outweigh the losses. Harvey Leibenstein created the “x” type, which measures a firm’s ability to maximize its output from a given input. Another model states that it exists only when nobody can be placed in a better situation without making someone else worse off; that model is named for Vilfredo Pareto. For 10 points, give this term that describes how smoothly an economic system is functioning.<br>ANSWER: <u>efficiency</u><br><br>2. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 1 2008)<br>Like Thomas Paine, he wrote a pamphlet entitled "The Crisis," though his was in support of building workhouses. He joined with such men as Charles Babbage to found the Statistical Society of London, though his major work uses little data. That work argues that vice, misery, and self-restraint are the only ways to prevent the arithmetic increase of food supplies from being outstripped by the geometric increase of food consumers. For 10 points, name this author of An Essay on the Principle of Population, who predicted inevitable starvation of the poor.<br>ANSWER: Thomas Malthus<br><br>3. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2008)<br>The ancestor of these languages displayed "ablaut" in the vowels, and some modern forms introduced new vowels through coloration. That ancestor also had at least five voiced aspirated stops. This family may be either the containing group or equal relative of the Anatolian languages, such as Hittite, and includes such dead tongues as Kuchean and Turfanian, the Tocharian languages. It also has Albanian, Celtic, and Greek branches. For 10 points, name this language family in which Sanskrit, Persian, German, Latin, and English are also found.<br>ANSWER: Indo-European<br><br>4. Social Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2009)<br>Lesser known works by this man include Totem and Taboo, The Future of an Illusion, and Why War?, for which he won the Goethe Prize. He explored the conflict between the individual's quest for freedom and the titular institution's demand for conformity in Civilization and Its Discontents and, in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, introduced the idea of the Oedipus complex. Defining the id, ego, and superego, this is, for 10 points, what Austrian psychologist who developed psychoanalysis and wrote The Interpretation of Dreams?<br>ANSWER: Sigmund <u>Freud</u> [accept <u>Sigismund Schlomo Freud</u>]<br><br>5. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 16 2011)<br><strong>This thinker collected his lectures at Bordeaux in “Pedagogical Evolution in France,” and one of his works makes a distinction between the sacred and the profane while analyzing Aboriginal totemism. This uncle of Marcel Mauss posited that primitive societies exhibit mechanical solidarity in another work. This author of The Elementary Forms of Religious Life and The </strong> Division of Labor in Society also wrote book describing the anomic, altruistic, and fatalistic forms of the title action. For 10 points, name this French sociologist who wrote Suicide.<br>ANSWER: David Émile <u>Durkheim</u><br><br>6. Social Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>This author determined that the concept of rights ought to be replaced with a concept of capabilities in his essay “Equality of What,” outlining some of his work with Martha Nussbaum. That approach also features prominently in his Inequality Reexamined. This author's liberal paradox suggested that requiring Pareto efficiency of voting schemes was irrational, and he offered relaxing transitivity to suggest voting systems almost good enough for Arrow's impossibility theorem. His best known work illustrates that food distribution mechanisms were often larger factors than food quantity in causing starvation. For 10 points, name this author of Poverty and Famines and Collective Choice and Social Welfare.<br>ANSWER: Amartya <u>Sen</u><br><br>7. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>There are actually two versions of this statistic; one, denoted W, represents Clerical Workers and Urban Wage Earners, while the other, denoted U, also incorporates a "Chained" version. Computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it groups items into eight major categories, such as Housing, Transportation, and Food and Beverages. Thought it does not include non-economic factors such as safety, it is often referred to as a cost-of-living index. For 10 points, name this statistic that computes the price of a representative "basket" of goods bought by consumers, which can therefore be used as a measure of inflation.<br>ANSWER: <u>Consumer Price</u> Index [or <u>CPI</u> ]<br><br>8. Social Science/All (Maryland Spring Classic 2005)<br>Because of the various subtleties included in the creator's theory, many critics of psychological theory have concluded that this term is merely nothing more than psychobabble. Some characteristics of people distplaying this trait include a fully internalized sense of morality, as well as a closeness to people and a general appreciation for life. For ten points, what is this term, the apex to Abraham Maslow's pyramid of needs?<br>ANSWER: self­actualization (prompt on early “pyramid of needs” or “hierarchy of needs”  buzz)<br><br>9. Social Science/None (SCOP Novice 2013)<br><strong>Theoretically, the price elasticity of this concept is always negative, though Veblen and Giffen goods experience an increase in this as price increases. This concept is theoretically determined by income alone. Its curve has a </strong> negative slope, giving a single equilibrium price at the intersection point with the supply curve. For 10 points, name this economic concept that describes how much of a good consumers want to buy.<br>ANSWER: demand (curve)<br><br>10. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>The Suda was an early encyclopedia written in this language. One version of this language, dubbed Koine, was prevalent during classical times, and it was in that version that the Septuagint version of the Bible was written. Its Dimotiki type is currently used in the modern day nation that bears its name, while, in Medieval times, its Byzantine form was widely used. For 10 points, name this language spoken in Athens.<br>ANSWER: <u>Greek</u><br><br>11. Social Science/All (MW GSAC XVII 2009)<br>In one work, this thinker claimed that a state is a community which monopolizes the legitimate use of physical force, or the “right to use violence,” and discussed how one can “live for” or “live off” the titular field. In addition to Politics as a Vocation, this thinker discussed the stress placed on the concept of beruf in another work which theorizes that a lack of social mobility and condemnation of expenditure as part of Calvinist doctrine gave rise to the titular phenomenon. For 10 points, name this German sociologist and author of The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.<br>ANSWER: Max <u>Weber</u><br><br>12. Social Science/All (GDS Ben Cooper Memorial 2010)<br>This man described opposites like the sun and moon and life and death with the word “syzygy” [SIZZ-uh-jee], and he summarized his theories in the introduction to the Evans-Wentz translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. He designated Eve, Helen, Mary, and Sophia as four stages of male development, and his work was the basis of the [*] Myers-Briggs personality test. His other theories include synchronicities and the anima. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist who created the idea of archetypes in his theory of the collective unconscious.<br>ANSWER: Carl Gustav <u>Jung</u> [YOONG]<br><br>13. Social Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>Named after a founding member of the Congressional Policy Advisory Board, this concept has a prohibitive range inside of which the economic effect outweighs the arithmetic effect. The supporters of this concept point to the short- term impacts of the economic policies of Coolidge, Kennedy, and Reagan, while its detractors point to the long-term impacts of the same policies. Its founder has justified it by using tax revenue projections in his home state of Califor- nia, and its supporters generally argue for tax cuts. This concept was named by Jude Wanniski, who claims he first saw it at a dinner with Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney drawn on a napkin. Name this graph based on the idea that no income is brought in by either a zero or one hundred percent tax rate.<br>ANSWER: <u>Laffer</u> Curve<br><br>14. Social Science/All (Ladue Invitational Spring Tournament 2012)<br><strong>One work by this man claims that a stationary state is preferable to perpetual economic growth because the latter destroys the environment and leads to a lower quality of life, while he argues that individual liberty leads to moral development in another of his works which advocates for equality of the sexes. Though not Malthus, this author of Principles of Political Economy and The </strong> Subjection of Women supported free speech in a work which also proposes that individual are free to act as long as others are not hurt according to his “harm principle.” This author of On Liberty advocated for the “rule” form of a consequentialist idea pioneered by Jeremy Bentham which strives to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number. For ten points, name this proponent of utilitarianism.<br>ANSWER: John Stuart <u>Mill</u><br><br>15. Social Science/None (SCOP Novice 2013)<br><strong>Ludwig Wittgenstein's example of this phenomenon was a duck-rabbit. Some of these phenomena caused by lateral neural inhibition include the Hermann grid, which consists of white gridlines, black squares, and </strong> apparent grey dots at the intersections of the grids. Another example, the Rubin vase, can appear as the silhouette of two faces.

Social Science/All (MSU/UD Housewrite 2012)<br><strong>This phenomenon could theoretically allow each consumer to be charged their reservation price, and increasing returns to scale allow a “natural” form of it. In this situation, prices are set above marginal revenue; thus, firms are</strong> price-makers. Intellectual property is a temporarily protected one due to patent and copyright law. AT&T and Standard Oil were examples of these that were broken up by antitrust suits. For 10 points, identify this market state in which there is only one supplier of a particular good, the opposite of perfect competition.<br>ANSWER: <u>monopoly</u> [or word forms, do not accept or prompt on “monopsony”]<br><br>19. Social Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>A book discussing the impacts of the Green Revolution, written by Eric Ross, is titled this man's “factor”.  His namesake league, founded by Charles Bradlaugh, showed a general level of discrimination against the poor and, in another work, he wrote that the value of land is equal to whatever value remains after the land has been used for cultivation. In one work, he argued against the poor laws, discussed the rapid growth of European colonies, and argued that while the human population grows at a geometric rate, the food supply only grows at an arithmetic rate, leading to epidemics, famines, and other disasters. FTP, identify this English economist who wrote the famous An Essay on the Principle of Population. <br>ANSWER: Thomas <u>Malthus</u><br><br>20. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2009)<br>This thinker's namesake containment hierarchy is sometimes co-named for Marco Schutzenberger.
