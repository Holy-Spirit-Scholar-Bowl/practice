In the article "Plans, Profits, and Bonuses," an economist here argued for using profit rather than output as an indicator of economic success. Paul Samuelson's Economics textbook contained predictions of when this country's GNP would surpass that of the United States that kept being pushed back in later editions. Joseph Schumpeter named 50 year-long economic growth waves after a man from here who supported a policy allowing small private enterprises during the 1920s.

This quantity is typically placed on the x-axis of the Beveridge curve, which compares this to vacancy rates.

The structural form of this quantity tends to be a long-term problem, as opposed to the seasonal form which is due to some work only being available in the summer or only in the winter.
