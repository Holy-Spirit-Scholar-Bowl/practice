1. Social Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>One part of this work mocks the ideas of "Little Icaria" and "Home Colonies." This work's second section outlines ten conditions for transition including a call for the land of all emigrants to be seized. This work's "Preamble" claims that "all the powers of Old Europe have entered into a holy alliance" including the pope, czar, Metternich, Guizot, and German police-spies. This philosophical work argues the history of all previous society is the history of class struggle in its first section "Bourgeois and Proletariat." This work famously begins by asserting, "A spectre is haunting Europe." Name this 1848 work written by Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx. <br>ANSWER: <u>Communist</u> Manifesto<br><br>2. Social Science/All (New Trier Scobol Solo 2008)<br>Nonfiction  Some of his books include Necessary Illusions, Deterring Democracy, and Keeping the Rabble in Line. A vocal opponent of American foreign policy, he labels himself as an Anarchist. He has also made an academic impact outside of politics, spending much of his career as a professor at MIT and writing books such as The Sound Pattern of English and Syntactic Structures. Name this linguist who designed a hierarchy of formal languages.<br>ANSWER: (Noam) Chomsky<br><br>3. Social Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>This man argued that the state of being sick must follow four sets of social rules in The Social System. He theorized that a society must progress through adaptation, goal attainment, integration, and latency in order to survive in its environment in Economy and Society and further developed the AGIL paradigm in The American University. He supported the cause to unite all social sciences with one overarching theoretical framework, grand theory, and crafted a social theory that states that society consists of smaller parts that each play their own role. For 10 points, identify this sociologist, author of The Structure of Social Action, best known for founding structural functionalism. [that's right, the entire question is in power]<br>ANSWER: Talcott <u>Parsons</u><br><br>4. Social Science/None (BISB 2013)<br>Murray Rothbard wrote a 1963 essay titled for this event in America. Irving Fisher identified nine factors which led to this event, factors which he called debt deflation. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwarz attributed this event to a 33% decrease in M2. This event was accompanied by a decrease in velocity, resulting in a massive shift left of the aggregate demand curve. It was blamed on business cycles by the Austrian school. Keynes advocated huge amounts of government spending to counter it. This event coincided with negative real shocks caused by the Smoot-Hawley tariff and the Dust Bowl. For 10 points, name this macroeconomic meltdown of the 1930s.<br>ANSWER: the Great Depression<br><br>5. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2000)<br>Formed in 1883, this group advocated a gradual approach to socialism, with the ultimate objective of establishing public ownership of the means of production and distribution. Among the major leaders of this “society” were Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Herbert George Wells, and George Bernard Shaw. For ten points, what was this socialist organization that derived its name from a Roman general?<br>ANSWER: the <u>Fabian Society</u>  RELATED BONUS: Answer these questions about the Fabians for ten points each.<br><br>6. Social Science/All (FKT 2013)<br>This man proposed his theory of “binding” in a series of lectures in Pisa, and he wrote the essay “The Responsibility of Intellectuals.” This thinker also proposed a gap between the exposure of children to language and the rate and depth to which they learn language, which he called “the poverty of the stimulus.” He also proposed that the abstract “deep structure” of sentences could relate to their “surface structure.” He presented the idea of transformational-generative grammar in Syntactic Structures and composed the grammatically correct but meaningless sentence “colorless green ideas sleep furiously.” For 10 points, name this MIT linguist.<br>ANSWER: Noam Chomsky<br><br>7. Social Science/None (SCOP Novice 2011)<br><strong>Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America was intended to be a study of these institutions. Jeremy Bentham designed one of these called the Panopticon, and Philip Zimbardo simulated one of these at the University of </strong> Stanford. Britain colonized Australia to serve as this institution, and San Francisco's Alcatraz Island was home to one of these buildings. For 10 points, name this type of institution that houses criminals.<br>ANSWER: prison (accept logical equivalents such as jail)<br><br>8. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>This thinker claimed that cities were closed communities in an essay in Economy and Society. One work by this man examines “nonlegitimate domination” and claims that legitimate authority can stem from tradition, law, or charisma. Another of his works discusses Richard Baxter in its fourth chapter and the origins of pietism in “The Religious Foundations of Worldly Ascetism.” That book by this author of </strong> Politics as a Vocation claims that the self-disciplined “vocational calling” of predestination led to the growth of the “iron cage” of the titular economic concept. For 10 points, name this German sociologist who wrote The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism.<br>ANSWER: Maximilian Carl Emil <u>Weber</u><br><br>9. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>One important psychological study of this phenomenon involved spiral-shaped colored disks in kindergarten classrooms. The stages of this concept are commonly outlined using the Atkinson-Shiffrin model. A key paper on one form of it, “Lost in the Shopping Mall,” was written by Elizabeth Loftus, who has served as an expert witness concerning this phenomenon. One form of it is affected by the </strong> “magic number” of seven plus or minus two, which can be expanded by “chunking.” Another form of it arises from sudden, traumatic events and is known as the vivid, “flashbulb” form of this phenomenon. For 10 points, identify this mental phenomenon that exists in sensory, short-term, and long-term types.<br>ANSWER: <u>memory</u> [accept word forms and equivalents]<br><br>10. Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2013)<br>This psychologist tested "spontaneous conviction" in test subjects by asking unexpected questions, and he examined the thought process of a group of boys by having them to describe bouquets of flowers. This psychologist described adaptation in terms of assimilation and accommodation, which are used by children to change or add to their "schemata." This psychologist pioneered the study of genetic epistemology, theorizing that infants develop "object permanence" in the sensorimotor stage before moving onto the preoperational stage. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist who formulated four stages of cognitive development.<br>ANSWER: Jean Piaget<br><br>11. Social Science/All (HSAPQ NASAT Tryout Set 2009)<br>He called the framework for nature to allow people to mentally develop genetic epistemology. He claimed that in one stage of life, we are unable to understand conservation. This man believed that we learn through adapting our schemas. He claimed that in one stage of life, we are unable to understand conservation. That phase is called the preoperational stage, which precedes the concrete and formal operational stages, but follows the sensorimotor stage. For 10 points, name this Swiss psychologist who studied the mental development of children.<br>ANSWER: Jean <u>Piaget</u><br><br>12. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>Hardin's tragedy of the commons is sometimes said to be an example of a multi-player generalization of it. It demonstrates that in a non-zero-sum game, the Nash equilibrium isn't necessarily Pareto optimal. In its iterated form, successful strategies tend to be nice, </strong> retaliating, forgiving, and non-envious, making tit-for-tat one of the best deterministic algorithms. In its payoff matrix as described by Douglas Hofstadter, the sucker's payoff must have the lowest value and the temptation to defect payoff must have the highest value. FTP, name this game in which each of two players can choose to either cooperate or defect.<br>ANSWER: <u>prisoner's dilemma</u><br><br>13. Social Science/All (Fall Novice 2010)<br>This psychologist wrote of Aboriginal incest in Totem and Taboo, and described the “oceanic feeling” that inspires religion in Civilization and Its Discontents.

For 10 points, name this Jewish Austrian who defined the id, ego, and superego and founded psychoanalysis.<br>ANSWER: Sigmund <u>Freud</u><br><br>14. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 10 2009)<br><strong>A thesis exploring the effect of this institution on society was based on Max Weber's theory of rationalization and described society as a system of "iron cages." That thesis about this institution, by George Ritzer, consisted of four axes: efficiency, calculability, predictability, and control. Benjamin Barber contrasted a type of globalization named for this business with </strong> jihad, and another social critic filmed himself eating here three times a day for a month. For 10 points, name this restaurant, the subject of Morgan Spurlock's Super Size Me.<br>ANSWER: McDonald's<br><br>15. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 11 2009)<br><strong>It is the number of stages in Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development, the title number of "Crises" described in a 1962 book by Richard Nixon, the number of French composers in a grouping that includes Darius Milhaud (DAR-ee-oos ME-yoh) and Arthur Honegger, and the number of days in a </strong> 1967 war that ended with Israel controlling the Gaza Strip. It is also the third triangular number and smallest perfect number, and appears three times in the Number of the Beast. For 10 points, give this number that equals a half-dozen.<br>ANSWER: six<br><br>16. Social Science/None (NTSS 2013)<br>Cläre [KLAR-uh] Tisch supported this system in a namesake calculation debate against Ludwig von Mises and other members of the Austrian school of economics. Joseph Schumpeter asked whether this system can work in a book about capitalism, this system, and democracy. People wanting a gradual transition to this system started the Fabian Society. Vietnam claims to be this type of republic, and the Soviet Union claimed to be a union of this type of republics. This was a stage that would precede the common ownership of communism according to Marxists. Name this planned economy in which the means of production can be controlled by the government.<br>ANSWER: socialism [or socialist]<br><br>17. Social Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2010)<br>When the US Navy called for a project attempting to sink German Bismarck-class battleships, this psychologist stepped up, trying to develop a pigeon-guided missile. He developed the three schedules of reinforcement and his daughter was never put in his air crib. One of his most famous works is a sequel to a Henry David Thoreau work asserting a utopian society of Planners, Managers, and Workers, Walden Two. His other work, Beyond Freedom and Dignity posits that people don't have free will in a world of stimuli. For 10 points, name this behaviorist who developed a name sake box and the operant conditioning chamber.<br>ANSWER: B(uurhus) F(rederic) <u>Skinner</u><br><br>18. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 10 2009)<br><strong>This man coined the term “peak experiences,” which are moments of instense satisfaction. He outlined his theory in the book Towards a Psychology of Being, which is representative of his humanist psychological practices. In his major theory, once a person meets his </strong> physiological, security, belonging, and esteem needs, then it may be possible for him to achieve self-actualization. For 10 points, name this psychologist who developed the “hierarchy of needs.”<br>ANSWER: Abraham <u>Maslow</u><br><br>19. Social Science/None (LIST 2014)<br><strong>This man names a hierarchy with Schützenberger whose Type-1 level can be interpreted with a linear bounded automaton. In one work, this thinker defined the terms "competence" and "performance." This man criticized Skinner's belief that children are conditioned to develop a </strong> verbal behavior, and instead proposed an inherent acquisition device. This pioneer of the concept of transformational-generative grammar used the sentence "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" to demonstrate that a meaningless sentence can be grammatically correct. Syntactic Structures was written by, for ten points, what MIT linguist?<br>ANSWER: Noam Chomsky<br><br>20. Social Science/All (NTSS 2010)<br>This person wrote that anthropologists often lack historical records and assume their subjects serve for psycho- logical generalization in Time Perspective in Aboriginal American Culture. One of this writer's collaborations was with a Carlisle Indian School student who spoke Southern Paiute, Tony Tillohash, and this writer organized an influential one-page summary of Native American languages. The only book this person completed, which impacted research on drift, was Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech.
