Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2008)<br><strong>This concept was first described by Robert Torrens in an 1815 essay on the Corn Laws, but it is most commonly attributed to David Ricardo, who explained it in On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. It allows specialization in production, and it allows countries to consume beyond their production possibility frontiers. According to this theory, a country should export </strong> goods which it can produce at a low opportunity cost, and import goods which other nations can produce at a lower opportunity cost than its own. FTP, name this economics principle which states that a country can still benefit from trade even if it doesn't have an absolute advantage in the production of any good.<br>ANSWER: <u>comparative</u> advantage<br><br>7.

Social Science/None (PACE NSC 2016)<br><strong>Robert Dahl developed five criteria to describe this kind of system in a book about it "and its Critics." Richard Rorty wrote that this idea is prior to any philosophical justification. The second volume of a work about this kind of system argues that its literature expresses a greater number of "new ideas" and "new words." The idea that these systems do not wage war against each other was first outlined in Immanuel </strong> Kant's essay Perpetual Peace. An author's travels with the Frenchman Gustave de Beaumont led him to conclude that this system suffers from the "tyranny of the majority;" that book by Alexis de Tocqueville examines this concept "in America." For 10 points, name this system of government in which people elect rulers, which began in Athens.<br>ANSWER: democracy<br><br>12. Social Science/All (Fall Novice 2010)<br>The triangle model splits this phenomenon into built-in, demand-pull, and cost-push types, while its inverse relationship to unemployment was plotted by the inaccurate Phillips curve.

While working on his thesis, he discovered the intensifying nerve of the heart, and he developed an experiment stemming from I.M. Sechenov's attempt to find the mechanisms behind psychic activity.

Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>While in most nations this act is illegal, Sweden, Japan, and France notably do not prohibit it. Tantra Buddhists encourage it, and the implication of the alliance theory of Claude Levi-Strauss is that prohibition of it is at “the dawn of culture” and “culture itself” because it forces kin groups to interact. The Westermarck Effect suggests that it is avoided because of environment and not instinct, and it may not necessarily be biologically disadvantageous since some harmful genes are dominant.
