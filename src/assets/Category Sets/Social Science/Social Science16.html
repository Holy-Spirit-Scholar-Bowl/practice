1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL States 2011)<br>One experiment that studied this concept involved a cat trapped in a box that would open when a certain region was pressed. This can diminish over time until it disappears in a process called “extinction.” In a famous study of this, dogs began to salivate at the sound of a bell. This concept has “operant” and “classical” varieties, the latter of which was studied in dogs by Ivan Pavlov. For 10 points, name this concept in psychology, the pairing of a stimulus with a response.<br>ANSWER: <u>conditioning</u> [prompt on classical or <u>operant conditioning</u> before they are read]<br><br>2. Social Science/All (BATE 2009)<br>The implosive type is common in Seerseer-Siin while the uvular type is prevalent in Tlingit. Amharic and Tzeltal have an ejective type which feature a buildup of pressure and a glottal stop. The stop type is formed by halting the flow of air in the vocal apparatus while the lateral type is formed by letting escape air around the sides of the tongue. More common types include the dental which is formed with the tongue at the tip of the teeth and the nasal type which forces air through the nose. In general, they are classified as a group of sounds that require a partial to full closure of the breath channel. FTP, identify these letters that contrasts with vowels.<br>ANSWER: <u>Consonants</u> <br><br>3. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2009)<br>This man argued that economics is not “up to date” because it's not an evolutionary science, and that science is the defining characteristic of the west in “The Place of Science in Modern Civilization.” In his most famous work, he asserted that the “belief in luck” leads to proclivity to gambling, which can be traced back to the human predatory culture. He also discussed technocracy in The Engineers and the Price System.

Social Science/All (Vanderbilt ABC/2011 VCU Winter 2010)<br>The transaction demand for money does not vary with this quantity, but the asset demand does. This quantity is inversely related to the amount of investment because investment will only occur if the rate of return exceeds this quantity. This quantity is low in a liquidity trap, where investors avoid certain assets whose price would decline with a rise in this quantity; those assets are bonds. Overnight transactions between banks are governed by the Fed Funds one.

Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2014)<br>The double dividends hypothesis pertains to the effects of this concept, of which the Pigouvian type is used to match the individual and societal marginal cost curves. This concept is influenced by marginal benefits received in Lindahl’s model. Frank P. Ramsey proposed that, like monopolistic pricing, this should be inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand in order to reduce deadweight losses. The Laffer curve plots revenue against its rate. Supply-side economics, promoted by Ronald Reagan, includes their reduction. For 10 points, name these levies imposed by a government.<br>ANSWER: <u>tax</u>es<br><br>8. Social Science/All (TJ NAREN 2010)<br>This work's last section, "Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth", discusses taxation and explains why debts from wars are unlikely to be paid off. Book Four of this work, "Of Systems of Political Economy", attacks mercantilism and specifically protectionist tariffs. Its first section compares agricultural societies to industrial ones, and studies pin manufacturing to illustrate ways in which the division of labor can increase industrial productivity.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>One early Supreme Court case on this topic saw Secretary of Commerce Philip Klutznick sued over a program for “MBEs” by ventilation company owner Earl Fullilove; that case was reversed by Richmond v. Croson. Strict scrutiny was applied to this concept in Adarand Constructors v. Pena, which featured a notable concurrence condemning all forms of this practice by </strong> Clarence Thomas. Cases that accepted “individualized inquiry” but struck down the use of a “points system” in this practice were brought by Grutter and Gratz against Lee Bollinger, then president of the University of Michigan.

The first written account of this idea was made by James Long after watching some- body's final bear hunt. Used as the title of a book written before The Golden Bough by James George Frazer, this con- cept was claimed by Sigmund Freud to be the first form of father-surrogate; Freud stated that this belief system pre- vented incest and linked this concept with taboo. Believers of this concept sometimes associate myths with the original ancestor of a clan. This term originally came from the Ojibwe language.

Social Science/All (Fall Kickoff Tournament 2010)<br>In the fifth book of The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith discusses flooding in the Swiss canton of Unterwald in a section devoted to this topic. Its Spahn and Tobin forms are related to currency exchange, and along with political economy it is the titular topic of a David Ricardo work introducing the law of comparative advantage.

Social Science/None (Maggie Walker GSAC 2011)<br>This experiment is the subject of the documentary Quiet Rage, and its conductor theorized about its results in his book The Lucifer Effect. Christina Maslach objected to this experiment, in which one of its most famous subjects acquired the nickname "John Wayne."
