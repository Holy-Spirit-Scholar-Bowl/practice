Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 9 2009)<br><strong>In Spanish, this construction is formed by replacing the "o" in the first personal singular form with the ending for the opposite type of verb. In English, it exists in fixed phrases such as "until death do us part" and "long live the king." In Italian, this construction is used in clauses subordinated to the phrase "I think that," in contrast to French, where the </strong> indicative would be used. For 10 points, name this grammatical mood, which typically expresses emotion, opinion, or uncertainty.<br>ANSWER: <u>subjunctive</u> mood<br><br>4. Social Science/All (DAFT 2009)<br>One sufferer of this phenomenon is Shawn Hornbeck who was diagnosed with it following the discovery of Michael J. Devlin by the police. An opposite version of this phenomenon has been proposed following an abduction at the Japanese Embassy in Peru and has been called the Lima syndrome. This phenomenon is named after the Norrmalmstorg robbery of Kreditbanken and was coined by criminologist Nils Bejerot during a news report. Patty Hearst is, for 10 points, a sufferer of this psychological response that sees hostages in abduction cases show signs of loyalty to abductors, named after the capital of Sweden.<br>ANSWER: <u>Stockholm</u> syndrome<br><br>5. Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>This man's fieldwork was used as the basis for Friedrich Engels's The Origins of Family, Private Property, and the State. In one work, this thinker described six different types of familial organizations that he used as an argument for the fundamental unity of human society. This anthropologist formulated a series of benchmark cultural achievements that he used to classify the titular </strong> groups of one work along an evolutionary scale. Those ethna determine whether a society is barbaric, civilized, or savage.

Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2013)<br>John Braithwaite argues that disintegrative shaming reinforces this behavior, which comes after humiliation according to Jack Katz’s The Seductions of [this concept]. The innovator is most susceptible to it according to Robert Merton’s strain theory, while Steven Pinker linked it to abortion rates. Segregation of the lower-class by this action prevents rebellions according to Michel Foucault.

Social Science/All (HFT 2009)<br>This thinker searched for a “standard commodity” that would reflect his “labor-embodied” theory of value. Roberto Barro developed a theory of government finance called this man's "equivalence." He discussed situations where scarcity of land led to disproportionate individual benefit for landlords compared to the real social value of their land as examples of his namesake rent. He criticized the agricultural tariffs imposed by the Corn Laws and wrote Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, in which he introduced comparative advantage. For 10 points, name this British economist who espoused the “iron law of wages.”<br>ANSWER: David <u>Ricardo</u><br><br>8. Social Science/All (HSAPQ VHSL Regular Season 2011)<br>This action was the subject of a 1940 study by Franklin Burdette. Rule XXII (twenty two) offers one countermeasure to these and that rule was created after the failure of Woodrow Wilson's efforts to arm merchant ships. The use of this was preserved by the Gang of 14 and one way of getting rid of it is the "Nuclear Option." This can be stopped by a cloture vote. The longest one of these carried out by an individual in the U.S. was carried out by Strom Thurmond. Stopping one requires 60 senators. For 10 points, name this action in the U.S. Senate where a senator refuses to stop talking, thus preventing a vote on a bill.<br>ANSWER: <u>filibuster</u><br><br>9. Social Science/None (Masonic 2014)<br>Two fixed-weight variants of this measure are Laspeyres [las-pear] and Paasche [pa-sheh]. In the United States, the example of these focused on producers is called wholesale. To calculate real GDP, the United States utilizes the chain-weighted version of this, which accounts for changes in quantities. One common calculation of this involves a fixed bundle in the base period, and is referred to as the "consumer" one. Name this value which compares the cost of the same goods in different periods, often used as a measure of inflation.<br>ANSWER: consumer price index (accept cost index or CPI, prompt on "index" or "inflation", accept indices for index)<br><br>10.

Social Science/All (HSAPQ 4Q 1 2008)<br>He supported the Corn Laws in Grounds of an Opinion and argued for an endogenous interpretation of money. In his most famous work, framed partially as a response to William Godwin's optimistic Political Justice, he argues that England's poor laws actually cause the poor to become more destitute and more numerous. His central contention was that a linear increase of available resources is naturally insufficient.

Social Science/All (LIST 2013)<br><strong>This action could be avoided by participants who were willing to pay in one study by Rotten­streich and Hsee that analyzed “strong-emotion” decisions, and Joseph Brady used this action to determine whether control was a factor in stress-related illnesses in his “Executive Monkey” study. Dogs who were not able to stop these actions in a study conducted by Martin Seligman developed </strong> learned helplessness, while another experiment played recordings of these when a “learner” failed to remember a word pair.

Social Science/All (Chitin 2008)<br>Its name was coined by Wall Street Journal editor Jude Wanniski in 1978, and it is a major foundational basis for an economic theory decried as “Voodoo” by George H.W. Bush.  It holds that at both 0% and 100% levels of its primary object, the government actually gains no revenue.  As a result, proponents of this curve argue that in many cases, cutting taxes will actually result in more profits for the government.  For 10 points, which economic curve, famously first drawn by its popularizer on a cocktail napkin, was crucial for Ronald Reagan's supply-side economic policy?<br>ANSWER: <u>Laffer</u> curve<br><br>20.
