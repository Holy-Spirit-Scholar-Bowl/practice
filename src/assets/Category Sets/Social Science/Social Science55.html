1. Social Science/All (HSAPQ Tournament 8 2009)<br>The title of the first volume of Deleuze and Guattari's Capitalism and Schizophrenia criticizes this concept.

Social Science/None (BISB 2013)<br>Ragnar Frisch names a measurement of the elasticity of the supply of this commodity. The supply curve for this commodity will bend backwards and have a negative slope for high prices. The marginal revenue product for this determines its demand curve. A now outdated solution to the paradox of value is that the inherent value of an object depends only on the amount of this needed to produce it; that idea is credited to Karl Marx. Along with land and capital, it's one of the factors of production. The intersection of this good's supply and demand curves occurs at a price called a wage. For 10 points, name this good demanded by firms and supplied by workers.<br>ANSWER: labor<br><br>4. Social Science/All (HSAPQ ACF 2 2008)<br>The "network" type of this concept, according to Stephen Margolis, can be broken down into autarky and synchronization. Problems associated with them can be resolved through criminalization of an economic activity, though a Pigovian tax is more effective. Social costs are defined as private costs plus the cost of these. The free rider problem concerns positive ones, while negative ones include the Tragedy of the Commons. For 10 points, give this term from economics in which parties uninvolved in an economic decision are nevertheless affected by it.<br>ANSWER: externality [or externalities]<br><br>5. Social Science/All (Harvard Fall Tournament 2010)<br>This concept was inspired the ability of individuals to recognize a six- tone melody that had been transposed into a new key, a study reported in a work by Christian von Ehrenfels. Later experiments on chimpanzee problem- solving by Wolfgang Kohler and the phi phenomenon by Kurt Koffka helped develop its principles of psychophysical isomorphism and totality, while other experiments involving optical illusions illustrated its idea of multistability and emergence. For 10 points, name this psychological theory advocated by Max Wertheimer, whose fundamental principle is the law of pragnanz.<br>ANSWER: <u>Gestalt</u> psychology<br><br>6. Social Science/All (Prison Bowl 2011)<br>Positional types of these effects result from competition between actors that leads to inefficiency, such as conspicuous consumption. They can be offset by bargaining and well-defined property rights instead of by government regulation, according to the Coase theorem. Positive types of these give rise to the free rider problem and negative types may be countered by levying Pigovian taxes, such as a “carbon tax.” Common examples of these economic effects include public parks and industrial pollution. By definition, they affect a third party who did not take part in the causative transaction. For 10 points, name these extra costs or benefits not accounted for by prices.<br>ANSWER: <u>externalities</u> or <u>spillovers</u> [accept word forms]<br><br>7.

Social Science/All (PACE NSC 2011)<br><strong>He contrasted groups of intrigue with those which “cling to principles rather than to their consequences” to define small and great political parties. He warned that by concentrating power in “an irresponsible person” constitutional democracies could fall prey to “soft despotism” in one text. In that same book, he described how “I myself met with the last of the Iroquois, who were begging alms” in a chapter on the “Present and Probable Future Conditions of the </strong> Indian Tribes.” Late in his career he analyzed France under Louis XVI in The Old Regime and the Revolution.

Morris developed an experiment of this type in which powdered milk was used to make opaque water. Latent learning is associated with these experiments when rewards are not introduced until later, while Watson and Carr's kerplunk experiment was named for the sounds participants made when the length of the type of experiment was changed. In the T-type of these experiments, the subject is presented with two equivalent options, only one of which leads to a reward.
