He wrote a six-volume history of England, and this man provided a counterexample to his Copy Principle by proposing a “missing [*] shade of blue.” Also known for separating “is” from “ought”, in his most famous work, he defined moral philosophy as “the science of human nature;” that work supposedly woke Kant from his “dogmatic slumber.” For 10 points, name this Scottish empiricist author of Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.<br>ANSWER: David <u>Hume</u><br><br>14.
