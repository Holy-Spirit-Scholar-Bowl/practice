1. Philosophy/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>In Book VI of Plato's Republic, this concept is analogized to rays from a sun which represents the form of the Good. According to Tarski's "semantic" theory of this concept, it can only be identified in a language L using a "meta-language". This was the second of three title concepts in a British work of logical empiricism by A. J. Ayer. Coherentists reject the </strong> correspondence theory of this concept. Tests for deductive validity assume that all premises have this property. Wittgenstein developed a diagram showing outputs of this property and its opposite after applying logical operators, called its namesake "tables." For 10 points, name this property of all tautologies and of those statements in classical logic which are not false.<br>ANSWER: truth [or word forms, such as true; do not accept \"truth value\"]<br><br>2. Philosophy/All (PACE NSC 2010)<br><strong>This man included “The Genteel Tradition in American Philosophy” in his critique of contemporaries like Bergson, Winds of Doctrine. One book by this thinker rejects Kant's theory of disinterestedness and posits that the title concept arises from personal connection rather than art. He argued that ideals originate from the four forms of experienced reality in a collection examining the titular concept “in religion” and “in common sense.” Another work by this author of </strong> The Sense of Beauty claims that philosophy must begin “in media res” and asserts that idealism is irrelevant since the world is understood through the pragmatic belief in our senses embodied by the first titular concept.

This author of On the Improvement of the Understanding discussed how it follows from the nature of a triangle that its three interior angles should not be equal to two right angles and claimed that God is </strong> Nature and Nature is God in his most famous work, which refutes Descartes’s mind-body dualism and advocates Pantheism.

Philosophy/Norse (PACE NSC 2014)<br><strong>This issue is addressed by philosopher William Rowe with the example of a deer caught in a forest fire. John Hick's argument from "soul-making" and Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense both aimed to resolve this issue. David Hume's statement of this problem included the question "Is he willing but not able? Then he is impotent." In the 17th century, the principle of sufficient reason was invoked to resolve this problem in </strong> Leibniz's Theodicy, which claimed that that this world was created as the "best possible world." Augustine defined away the central concept of this problem as a non-thing, since it is a mere lack of goodness. For 10 points, name this problem in religious philosophy which asks why a good God allows suffering.<br>ANSWER: <u>problem</u> of <u>evil</u> [accept any descriptive answer indicating the issue of whether, why, how, etc. a good God allows evil, suffering, etc. to exist; accept answers such as \"whether we live in the best of all possible worlds until \"best\" is read]<br><br>5.

Philosophy/None (BHSAT 2013)<br>This philosopher discussed the "unity of apperception" in a book where he used arguments based on unprovable facts about the mind, called transcendental deductions. He distinguished the unreachable noumenon from the sensible phenomenal world, and posited "man's emergence from self-imposed immaturity" in his essay "What is Enlightenment?" He forbid lying even to a murderer inquiring about one's best friend, discussed the beautiful and sublime in his aesthetic tract Critique of Judgment, and proved that synthetic a priori truths exist.

Philosophy/All (BHSAT 2012)<br>The first twelve chapters of this work attempt to axiomatize human nature, beginning with Sense and Imagination, after a preface which describes life as a “motion of limbs” and coined the term “body politic.” Its second section writes that differences of strength and craft make men equally able to kill each other; that section, “Of the Commonwealth,” describes the “war of all against all,” a pre-covenant state of nature in which life is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” For 10 points, name this work of political philosophy advocating for a single absolute sovereign, by Thomas Hobbes.<br>ANSWER: <u>Leviathan</u>: Or, the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Commonwealth Ecclesiastical and Civil<br><br>9.

Another work on this concept distinguishes one general form and many particular forms of justice in its fifth book. That work’s last chapter advocates political life if the ideal </strong> contemplative life is unattainable, and earlier advocates for eudaimonia, or happiness, as derived from virtues which are themselves the mean between two extremes.
